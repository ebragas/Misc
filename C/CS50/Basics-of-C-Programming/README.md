# The Basics of C Programming
### The Simplest C Program
**File Name:** _simp.c_
**Description:** Hello World in C

**Notes:**
- **#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;** includes the "standard I/O" library into the program. The Standard I/O library allows reading stndarding input (from keyboard) and write standard output (to screen), process text files from disk, etc.
- **int main()** declares the main function. Every C program must have a function named main. Execution starts at the first line of main.
- **{ }** denote code blocks.
- **printf** allows sending output to standard out. The format string is in quotes. Format strings allow string literals ("text") and symbols ("/n"), and placeholders ("%s").
- **return 0;** causes the function to return error code 0 (no error) to the shell that started its execution.
