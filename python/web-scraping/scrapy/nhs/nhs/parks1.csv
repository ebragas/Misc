5th Street Skatepark,,Open,Free,Outside,No,No,Mixture,No,,,Dreamland,Gem Stone Ave. and S. Baseline,83422,Driggs,"Driggs is a town of about 5000 in eastern Idaho, next to the Wyoming state line and near Jackson Hole. As you can imagine, a small town with lots of gravel streets offers very little to skate. There were endless complaints from the owners of the few skate-able spots and from the skaters. The 5th St. skatepark is the result of efforts by some skaters' mothers and the town of Driggs to provide a fun and challenging skate facility that would be legal and safe from traffic etc. The moms formed the Teton Valley Skateclub with not-for-profit status. The city of Driggs offered space in a not-yet-improved 10 acre park. 5th St. Park will eventually provide playground, picnicking, snow-sledding, Frisbee golf, a bmx track, and possibly other recreational facilities along with the skatepark. After about 3? years of fund-raising and meetings with the town, we are at the end of Phase 2, having spent $58,000. A small portion of that was tax money with the bulk coming from donations. Phase 1 was built during September '02 by a local concrete contractor with volunteer labor. It was designed by the Skateclub to offer ""street"" skating but also provide some transition in the form of wood quarter-pipes and concrete bowled corners. Opened at the end of September, it was a big success with very nice concrete and wood work. Phase 2 was designed to offer pool-style vertical skating. Some Skateclub members had skated some of the Oregon parks, where the parks created by Dreamland clearly stood out as the best. Dreamland was contacted and offered our small contract which was enthusiastically accepted. We were VERY excited to get them! Lodging was donated along with excavation. The perfectly arced coping was onsite when Mark Scott arrived. By the end of the first week he had the bowl ready for concrete with help from the Skateclub. Four other Dreamland concrete shapers arrived and two weeks later, Phase 2 was rideable. The Dreamland guys worked HARD for long hours, six days a week, and never wasted a dime of our money! They worked as though it was their own money for their own skatepark. From initial plans for the addition of just a bowl, we were able to add a large 6 ft. bowled corner, a small miniramp, and other improvements thanks to the volunteer labor input, primarily from Mark Goddard. Mark's overtime contributions spanned from design and co-ordination with Dreamland through welding and backhoe operation to rebar bending and concrete finish work. Now the park's been ridden for about 3 weeks to completely positive response. The bowl is pretty tight and will challenge and delight any vert skater. It's about 1500 square feet in area and just under 10 feet in maximum depth. There's a squared shallow end about 5 ft. in depth that's well under vertical and offers a halfpipe for coping tricks. It rolls off about 3 feet into the deep end that's formed into two lobes. One is more open with some straight sections of coping, and just goes to vertical at the coping. The other lobe is a tight pocket with about the top 2 feet over vertical. There are 3 hips. The coping is 3 inches diameter in perfectly machine-bent smooth arcs. Dreamland got the concrete very nearly perfect, there are no kinks or rough spots, with nice big transitions. The bowl carves very well with many flowing carving lines. It also provides the hips for flying. A skater can also fly out of the bowl, land on a ramp, and ride into the rest of the park. There's a shallow ramp from the bowl's rim down 3 feet to the rest of the park. With a grinding block at the top of the ramp, there is some protection against loose boards falling into the bowl. The city of Driggs is enthusiastic about the skatepark and helped with landfill and has provided signs, along with a port-a-john and trash receptacles. I was told by a city planner that the continuous complaints about skaters ended completely with the opening of the skatepark. We're having a grand opening August 16 with some prizes, food, music, a dance and bonfire, and lots of skating. In the future, Phase 3 will expand the park with more area for ""street"" skating, but will have to wait until funds are available. Driggs is located in the Teton Basin, alongside the Teton Mountains. It's on Idaho highway 33, about an hour from interstate highway I-15 and Idaho Falls. There is one stoplight on Main St. at the corner of Little Avenue. 5th St. is 5 blocks east on Little. 5th St. Park is 2 blocks south of Little, on the east side of 5th St. The skatepark is always open, free. Protective gear is strongly advised. As of now, bikes are allowed but under review considering recent damage to the concrete. Winter closes in about mid-November and lets up around mid-April. There's beautiful camping nearby. Come and ride 5th St. Skatepark! - Paul Brabenec  This is Phase 1 completed. Although this park is fairly small, it's been designed and built by skaters, with good quality and a lot of flow.  The concrete slab with bowled corners is 3600 square feet in area, measuring 60 x 60 feet. The concrete is glassy smooth and the transitions are as good as any you'll find. The bowled corners have 2 1/4 inch round steel coping that's perfectly smooth and free of kinks, dents, or rough welds.  The wooden construction of the ramps will permit easy changes to the park's design. All ramps are 3/4 ply forms with 2x4 or 2x6 joists on 6 inch centers, covered with 3/4 inch plywood (or 2 layers of 3/8), and skinned with 1/4 hardboard (masonite). All flat ramps have curved transitions at the bottom, and all ramps have 1/8 inch steel plates at the concrete. Coping is 2 1/4 inch round steel. The central funbox and ramps are modular to allow repositioning into other configurations.  Phase 2 is a bowl to be built by the Dreamland Skatepark crew and scheduled for early summer '03!

This is the best park in the Vegas area to date. Built and designed by the Site Design Group this park kicks ass. Upsides to this park are smooth cement, perfectly placed coping, a flowing design and the absence of desert landscaping (no gravel in the park = no flat spots). Downsides are the lack of vert and the crash factor. Rules are no bikes, no cussing, no tobacco, no food and pads are required. Only the no food rule was being enforced by the parks and rec baby sitter when I was there. Manimal Best design in Vegas to date. The concrete work still needs improvement. 10,000 to 15,000 sq ft. street obstacles tucked in corner of park. Nice and very flowable. No pushing, just pumping the endless lines. could be better, but with the concrete they are pouring out here, I'll take this park and love it. i will have my concrete license in early 2004 so watch out, 'cuz things are gonna change.

(quote below from Minneapolis Parks Dept. web site)  At this time, the MPRB is developing only Tier 1 skate parks, which have equipment no higher that 48 inches and attract no more liability than other park facilities such as playgrounds, ball fields, or wading pools.  A tier 1 designation seems like it should be the kiss of death, but still there were guys here who session it every day (weather permitting I assume) and seemed to be having fun with the pyramid, the rail, and flying out of the little, tiny, 1/4 pipe/launcher obstacle. One of us still managed to crush a finger pretty good (photo on request) so obviously something has been done right, but it is precious little. My verdict: Absolutely not worth special trip. If you are killing time and need to skate while your little sister is at a birthday party then by all means check it out.

From downtown Portland, it takes about 40-minutes to get there by going north on I-5 and taking the Battle Ground exit. Follow signs to Battle Ground and continue east on Main St. The park is just a few blocks east of the local high school and is near markets, restaurants and bars. Lights are on until 11 pm. This is another Dreamland creation and what they claim to be their largest yet at 28,500 sq. ft. http://www.dreamlandskateparks.com/battlegrounds.html This park has a large bowl that empties out to a pocket and what is being called the squadle... a squashed cradle with a flat spot the farther you get out on it. The bowl continues out to a 6-footish half-pipe and then a kinked mini-ramp. The street section is by far Dreamlands best yet. I counted 15 skates rolling the street course at one time.  There is also a very nice amoeba shaped swimming pool style bowl.  -Pablo",0.0,,,City,9909,,,

Guaranteed to provide an alternating ""go-fast/go-slow"" experience in a non-flow, push around layout. The coping is for appearance only, since its set in so far as to serve no practical purpose. The miniramp has no flat bottom - but a seam where opposing concrete sections pitch down to a midpoint. Dismal, really. And not a cheap installation, either: The crane costs alone to drop these turds is enough to build a decent skatelite miniramp. Located on Beach Street beside the West Haven beach. The place is free but was closed when I stopped by at 4 PM on a Monday. Eventually some bikers climbed in, but I didn't notice any skaters getting fired up and hopping the fence.

This skatepark sucks overall. It was made by the school committee to get the kids off the street and into a safe place to skate...it is in back of a teen center and a police station...hhaha. It is all wood and metal lips to the ramps. 15"" quarter pipe, no mini quarter pipe! that is what sux. There is a fun box w/ rail and ledge, 7"" spine, all the quarter pipes suck because the coping is about as big as a full pipe (you could skate in the coping), well it just sux.

Rather than fencing in the park and relegating it to under-utilized space, this facility is thoughtfully integrated into the City’s park system. Multiple entry points, large boulders that serve as spectator seating and colored concrete patterns contribute to this park’s inviting aesthetic. Interior landscaped areas with bushes, trees and grass provide skaters and spectators with a welcoming environment to enjoy the shade during the summer months. An artistic (and skateable!) entry sign also contributes to this park’s unique identity, making it unlike any other in the area.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,16974,,,

Take my advice and don't waist your time it is hard to find. All the ramps are made out of metal and its right next to a juvie home so a bunch of weirdos come out there with air horns while you trying to skate. They made a little kid cut his head open on the vert ramp cuz he went up for an air and they blew the air horn. Well just take my advice, it sucks sweaty anus!!!!!!!!!!!!! This park is worse than my driveway. -titanstud12 This is the same park as the other norman park listed on this site, i just had to tell everyone not to listen to the jackass who posted the other one. The park is kinda small, but its really not bad. Its got a good set up, so you can have good lines. Its NOT hard to find, its NOT next to a juvie home, theres NO wierdos with airhorns.

Blair Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,,Concrete,,No,Site Design,,1466 West Marshall Blvd,92401,San Bernardino,"The bowl is about 7 feet deep , and about 5 or 6 feet deep in the shallow. The cement finish is not super smooth, but is really not too bad. There is one weird lump on one of the hips. The coping is decent size and sticks out about right in most places. Whatever type of metal the coping is grinds very fast--feels like grinding on PVC. The street area looked retarded and useless. This is a very small park, and I would not go out of my way to skate it. Unless you find yourself lost near the 1600 block of West Marshall in San Bernardino, don't even bother.  - Eggvert",0.0,0.0 ,,City,3270,,,

Blaine Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,,No,Concrete,,,,,610 3rd St.,98230,Blaine,"The concrete at this park is very slick and it is hard to stay on your board without slipping on this ground. (1/3/2006) It is, for the most part, a pre-fab park. It is a wooden built park BECAUSE the duder who designed the thing believes that 1) concrete sucks in a way that you can't ever change it and 2) people (he) want(s) to change the park up to keep it 'fresh'. Duder, a bmx'r, also said that he didn't get jiggy with traveling to other parks and that traveling, in the end, sucked rocks. He can believe what he wants, but as far as I know, skaters WANT to travel. Skaters want to hit different spots, meet different people, etc. And why doesn't the mini go to vert? I mean, it's already 7-8' tall, why not go bigger? Probably because bikes don't need vert to get air. Anyway, my 2 cents on it. It's for kids. BTW, the ramp is/was surfaced with some sort of funky-ass rubber. ie; it expands when it gets hot. I have 99a wheels and was sliding all over BUT you WILL stick if you wear kneedpads and try to slide out. AS IF that makes any flaming sense! Serious. Gotta get used to rolling or skating real carefully. AND it is true. The concrete in the 'street' section is incredibly slick and the grind rails are set in the concrete. Trying to pump on the flatground, just doesn't work well. It reminds me of that old Tempe, AZ contest that Thrasher covered. I believe their quote was, ""like snot on ice"". It's pretty darn close. Destination? HA! It's a touch better than Bellingham but I'd skip both and go straight over the border.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,5811,,360-332-9394,http://www.extremesportsclub.org

It is backed up to a wall in the building which provides a giant vert wall with a sit out that juts out in a really tight area. It is great fun, but they are really uptight.

It's small (in area and height). One end has a mellow 4 ft. high four sided square bowl with one corner open to the rest of the park. The open corner has a hip (see photo). Opposite side of the bowl is a quarter pipe running the width of the park, with a pyramid/rail/box street elements in the middle, terminating in another quarter running the width of the park on the far side. On the other side of the far quarter is this weird super tight tranny 2 ft. high area, kinda fun. The park's fun when not crowded cause you can flow in and out of the bowl and the street area. The local kids were cool and some were doing big transfers over the deck from the quarter to the bowl. Not sure how to rate it, cause if there's tranny I usually have fun, but probably only a 5 or 6. I also skated Driggs ID. and Jackson Hole Wy. while out there, and those places were amazing, definitely worth the drive.  -aaron c.  (Aug 18 2003) Here's some pics from our trip to Montana last month, we hit Missoula, Bozeman, and Helena. A local 14 ripper kid told us of some full pipe off the Hwy to Helena. Well they were there, small, but ridable and there. The skatepark in Bozeman is right off the main street thru town, just stop at the skate shop on the main street and they will lead the way for ya....super cool guys. The park is super fun, built by Team Pain, and a lot like the Twin Falls park in basic layout/design. No vert there, but fun lines through out the park. While we there, Digimon showed up and threw out some sick tech tricks never seen before.  - Matt Splat",3.7,,,City,9120,,,

Even though your site is for skateboarders I have been here all my life and have been using your site to find parks wherever I travel. Anyways the park was closed down for a few years and they have been working on it since. Due to different problems to project was delayed a few times. The old park was built by skaters and about $13,000 was spent. The new park was professionally built and $265,000 was spent. And you can definitely see the difference! But finally the park had its grand opening yesterday 11/30/05 at 2pm and was really packed.The mayor was even there and there was a lot of community support with free snacks and drinks. Northern Wave, a local skate shop, helped sponsor the event and passed out gift certificates. The park was helped put in production by a group called Bremerton Skaters and Supporters United which was led by Lisa Gordon a teacher from Bremerton High School. But anyways I was there and took some new pictures to send to you because your Bremerton Park information was pretty old. The new park is entirely ""street"". There is no tranny at all. Just ledges/curbs, stairs, rails, etc. Feel free to put these pics on your site, so other skaters can have up to date information. It is in the same place as the old one so no need to change directions or map information. The new park is pretty nice though if you are into street, which I am.  -Josten",0.0,0.0 ,,City,6482,,,

Right on cue, like some covert military operation the concealed skaters of Brixham eagerly emerge from the camouflage of the bushes, board in hand to take ownership of their new GBH Skatepark.  For GBH?s project manager Russ, who designed the Brixham skatepark in conjunction with the local kids, this was the most fulfilling part of the whole project; the kids couldn?t wait a moment longer to session their ramps. This park was a long time in the conception period as Brixham 21 and Brixham Youth Enquiry Service (Y.E.S) struggled against seemingly impossible odds to find a site, almost losing the funding due to time constraints. Thankfully, the local council supported by Groundwork Torbay gave one final push and this sweet little baby of a skatepark was conceived. If you go down to the Brixham skatepark on Monksbridge Road, Devon today this is what you will find?.a super wide spine/ volcano mini, leading you into a fat hipped quarter. A huge low level pyramid, complete with grind rail and ultra wide flatbank Wembley gap section linked by not just one, but two quarters with a sub box for those bmxers out there to play with. And because size is everything a mammoth flatbank hip with integrated grind box, nice.",0.0,0.0 ,,,2806,,,

Brotherhood Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Mixture,No,No,,,Gondolgatan 16,128 32,Stockholm,"12/18/2007    Brotherhood Plaza is the first big skate plaza plaza project in Sweden with more than 20000 square feet of asphalt, grass gaps, bushes, trees, curbs, banks and hips that do not at all look like your average skatepark, more like real suburb or small town street spots.     Brotherhood and Stockholm city are planning to keep adding new spots to the plaza as soon as it can be funded. The goal for all spots is to disguise them as real street spots, to make pics or video shots taken there look more like street than skatepark and to add to the feeling when skating there.     As of now there are 20 times as many spots that has been drawn than the once that has been built, due to funding. The goal is to raise about $ 1.000.000 to 4.000.000 and meanwhile the skaters has ambitions to build more spots themselves.    Brotherhood Plaza welcomes media partners and sponsors. Lodging might be offered to teams that want to demo the plaza. Due to the Swedish weather its best to skate the plaza from late April to early October unless you want cold weather like on most photos shown here.

Right after completing an alright park in Ketchum (by Hailey), they went about 80 miles south to Buhl a small town near Twin Falls. This park is like a dreamland 18'+ cradle!!!! You can skate the back of cradle with opposing quarter. You can also skate the side of the cradle where it waterfalls into the shallow area. There snake run connecting deep to shallow, with a spine that is similar to aumsville, but the curves are curvier. The only flaws (if you could even call them flaws) are that you get going so fast in the deep area that you actually have to slow way down to go up the snake. Oh yeah the street area kind of sucks, but if you even care about the street area in this park you suck! lights are comin soon. helmets for under 18 The main bowl is a little confusing, but if you got air game, it's on. An escalating spine, lots of pockets and hips, and a snake run that leads into the ""big bowl"" with the ""world's largest cradle"". I liked this part the best and the vert was nice.

Butte Berkeley Bowl,,Open,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,Yes,No,Dreamland,Dreamland,E. 2nd St. and Garden Ave.,59701,Butte,"(9/22/2006) The Butte skatepark is probably less than 6,000 feet, but has two great bowls, and an interesting flow area, with some street features as well. Another Dreamland gem. The flow area is perfect for beginners of all ages, nice mellow banks and hips. The kidney bowl is probably around 8 foot deep, and has a fairly tight shallow end. Some will be attracted to this bowl, because of it's size and shape, and the fact that it has pool coping. Others might be attracted to the ""L"" shaped bowl, which also has pool coping, plus it has a huge bank wall for that extra speedy feeling. It also features a love seat. But the feature that you don't find too often is the nearly 12 foot deepend. The ""L"" shaped bowl seemed almost intuitive to skate. The faster I went, the more fun I had. Each wall sends you to the next and so on. - Dan hughes (9/22/2006) Beautiful bowls! This place is rad!

Carlson Skate park,,,Free,Outside,,No,Concrete,,,,,Rickman Rd NE. and Hyson Ct. NE.,97303,Keizer,"IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME...Four and a half years ago, Keizer police spent a lot of time chasing youngsters out of concrete business areas for skateboarding or biking. There was talk of new laws and tougher fines. Charlane and Steve Carlson took a different view. ""We said, 'Why don't we build them a place they can go?'. Their hard work and dedication paid off Saturday, July 10, 1999, when the City of Keizer held the grand opening for a new 21,611 sq.ft. outdoor skatepark, the largest outdoor concrete park on the West Coast. The Carlsons sat stunned as the city workers revealed a sign naming it Carlson Skatepark in their honor, followed by a US Congressional Citation for volunteerism.  ""We wanted to build something exceptional for the youth"", said Steve Carlson, and they did. The initial idea was for a modest park of about 8,000 sq.ft., but then the project came to the attention of architectural designer Bart Bennett.  ""He was obsessed"", says Charlane. He pushed and tweaked and fought for more. And then he came out on weekends and evenings to help shovel gravel and finish concrete. First he added a beginners area, then one bowl, then another. Now the park has 2 pyramids, 2 bowls, a saucer, semi-vert walls, a halfpipe, moguls, ledges, rails, and stairs.  As the plans unfolded, Charlane focused on raising money. ""The phone never stopped ringing for 3 years"". The Carlsons obtained substantial donations of material and time from local labor unions (carpenters, iron workers, plumbers, painters,firefighters), contractors, and building suppliers. Steve's specialty is concrete formwork, so he served as construction manager. During the final push this spring, the Carlsons lived onsite in a trailer.  About 1,000 people from babies to great-grandparents showed up for the opening Saturday. As the Carlsons received their well-deserved recognition and dignitaries made their speeches, about 500 boarders, skaters, and bikers rimmed the park's edge waiting in 90 degree sun for the ribbon to be cut. Local TV and newspaper reporters were present, and a radio station provided music all afternoon. Food and soda were free, donated by the labor unions. The plumbers and steamfitters stayed all afternoon, saving many a skater from heat exhaustion with free snocones.  The definition of glee was written all over the faces of those using the park. ""Mom, you won't have to wonder where I am anymore. You'll find me at the skate park"". by - Bart  Hey I just wanted to let you guys know about the new skate park out in Kiezer. its a really nice park real big its has: a large bowl and a small bowl a sort of pyramid complex thing with a spine on one end banks on the other and assorted other ramps on the other sides lots of ledges two hand rails and 2 sets of stairs real shitty concrete half pipe launch ramps for the kiddies and a separate smaller pyramid with a tit and some rhythms really good park most of the concrete is good except the big bowl and the half pipe those have a few bumps good for transition skating and street type stuff. People there are usually pretty cool except for all the little kids every where. It's also right next to the police station. It's outdoors, free, and all concrete. Right by city hall.

Carlsbad Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,,No,,,2560 Orion way,92008,Carlsbad,"4/24/2008 CB is one of the first public/free skateparks in SD county, it has lights, no fences and is free but is located right next to the police station so pad/helmet tickets are a real possibility (it cost me $200). The transitions are small/tight and the coping is pretty flat but the place definitely has some flow possibilities. It is basically 3 bowls connected with each bowl having different setups/obstacles. It has curbs on top of one bowl and curbs/ledges line the boarders of the place which add to the fun. If you like skating ditch like stuff, you will have fun here. If you are into bigger stuff, Encinitas is not far away. Some will like it, some will not, but for North County SD, it is great to a have park that you can hit in the evenings without paying (except maybe the ticket thing). Younger skaters who live nearby are stoked on the place and it is certainly the best (ONLY) park within miles. If you are around that area (2 miles E. of I-5), check it out for yourself. Carlsbad skatepark should be renamed Carls-really-bad skatepark. This place sucks, the tranny is too small, and the street oriented stuff is poorly designed. It is free and unsupervised, so it gets a 2 instead of a 1. Pads and helmets are required and, since it is located next to the police station, you can bet your ass that the pad rules are enforced. This place blows - only stop by if you happen to be in the hood.  -Takahashi  15,000 square feet of small concrete. It is free, outdoors, and pads are a must!

NOTE: park is not really on washington blvd. look for the sign or you'll get lost. Opens April 5th 2004. Hours of operation are: Wednesday-Friday 4pm-Dark, Saturday and Sunday 12pm-Dark.

Catoctin Skatepark,,,,Outside,Yes,,,,,,,130 Catoctin Circle SE,20178,Leesburg,"Its a 12,000 square foot lighted skating area built on an old double tennis court. Its being expanded next year to include a concrete section and possibly a dirt section for BMXers. As it stands, its an asphalt surface with skatelite quarter pipes, launch & land ramps, fun boxes, a couple of rails, two mini halfpipes forming a spine, and a 6ft half pipe with a 7ft extension, plus a couple of other structures. The park is supervised, and they require helmets (though they have been known to let the more advanced, adult visitors slide on that.) Those little metal scooter things that kids like to ride aren't allowed, but they never say anything as long as you are not causing problems. Lots of kids ride them. Normal hours are skateboard and inline skates only, but they have BMX only hours, Wed & Sat after 6pm, and Sun after 4pm. They will let you keep skating if very few bikers show up, but that is rare. The staff is cool and frequently join in on the ramps, or sit out popping ollies in the parking lot and chatting. The park is lighted and has vending machines and a port-o-let that is pretty clean -- at least by portolet standards, and there is a terrible sub sandwich shop & convenience store right across the street. Parking available. Hours are listed on the site referenced above, except they only show two BMX nights, when there is really 3. Oh, and they are putting in a sound system either later this year or early next year. As it stands, you can bring a boom box or park close and crank the car stereo. Regards, and happy skating.

Its pretty hot. You can get lots of speed, it has a huge bowl, its really tall(10' maybe), but it has curved edges, so you down drop down. You can be grinding on the 1/4 pipes all around the park. It had some jumps and some gaps you can land. Its a great park. There are 1/4 pipes all the way around, some you don't have to push hardly at all. It has long rail, a few tall and a few shorts. Its fenced in, but the front gate is this cool artwork of skaters. The place is covered with skating art, not grafiti, but cool art. You can tell the locals cherish this park, because its really clean. I mean it, its cleaner than Chico itself. I recomend highly.

Clippard park Skatepark,,Open,Free,Outside,No,,Concrete,Yes,,Grindline,Who Skates,Clippard Park,45251,Colerain Township,"10/18/2010 This skatepark looks very similar to the schematics that are already on the Concrete Disciples site, except that the brick bank/hip combo at the lower left was omitted entirely (cost constraints maybe?), and the hip at the end of the park is actually poured concrete, not brick. This park features two things of note. First of all, it's all extremely well-built. Especially the bowls- there isn't a ripple or a kink anywhere in them. The ""street"" obstacles are very legit, as well. The second notable feature are the millions of little skater/bmx kids that continually inhabit this park, as well as some over-amped parents that won't hesitate to call the cops on you if you dare say a bad word within earshot. There is also full-time a full-time ""caretaker"" on site, so littering and graffiti are a really bad idea here. -Bud Stratford, The Solitary Life",0.0,,,City,12093,,(513)385-7503,http://www.coleraintwp.org/clippard_park.cfm

Built out of pressure treated wood, and covered with Skatelite all over, it is a huge facility with more obstacles and ramps than can be described here. The highlights of the park would be a very wide, 3ft. tall mini ramp; An even wider, 6ft. tall midsized halfpipe; And, a huge, sprawling street course that features multiple quarterpipes, flat banks, handrails, boxes, and ledges. Well worth the drive from almost anywhere, this park clearly has something for everyone. Because it is built out of wood, it does require periodic maintenance. However, it appears to be well-kept, and there are signs of recent repairs to the park in several places. -Bud S. concrete platform. Wooden - couple small half pipes, some quarter pipes and rails.

The first section has a 5-6 foot 1/2 pipe with a 1/4 pipe on its side for transitions. They also have a three sided pyramid that is pretty tall with a low rail on it. And a funbox/manual pad that is about a 1-1 1/2 foot tall and probably 8 feet long that is good for grinding on. There is also a rail about the same height as the funbox. And at the opposite end of the park as the halfpipe is a small 6in tall funbox under construction and about a 8 foot tall quarter pipe.  The other section is the same size as the first but it doesn't have anything in it except what the locals put in it. The whole second side is surrounded by bank type things. The 1/2pipe is metal and has a bubble but it isn't bad. The parks surface is like the stuff they make streets out of but the obstacles are cement. The park is located at the Memorial Park past the outfield of the baseball field in downtown CDA.  Peace Out, Steve Seling  Thanx to Steve for writing this park up. The only thing I might ad is that the coping on the mini-ramp is big where transfers are made and the locals were really cool. I had a good time skating this park!  -J.

Cocoa Beach Skatepark,,Open,Pay,Outside,Yes,,Concrete,,No,Team Pain,Team Pain,1450 Minuteman Causeway,32931,Cocoa Beach,(9/8/2006) Cocoa Beach (Cocoa Beach FL) That park has long since been completed. Massive lines; the park is tight and fast so bring your carving legs out for the day. The cradle is wicked awesome to hit but a bit tricky to find a line to get into it with speed. You can spend hours in any lil' area of this park making up lines and flying. There is a small street course with a mini and a really awkward transition. I dunno. Didn't spend much time in that lil' region although the mini did look fun; there were a lot of kids on it. If you are taking A1A south in Cocoa Beach then you would turn right heading west on Minutemen Causeway (I think that is the name of the road I kid you not!) and it's about 2 miles down on the south side at the back end of a driving pad for student drivers. It's a pay for park with a minor pro-shop (they've got the essentials). I dunno if there are lights but the park opens at 10am for sure. It's fenced in by chainlink and the outer grounds around it are a mosquito breeding ground. If you show up early in the morning have some bug spray. There are drinks available but not much of a selection. There are a few picnic tables to put your stuff down. There is a children's playground right next door. No outside speakers for music so bring your stereo. Can you tell I was spoiled at Orlando Skate Park? Haha! It was Team Pain... I mean... How can you go wrong? I would give this park a 10 for tranny and the street course maybe a 4 at best. It was a small area and every time I went to fly through someone was slamming into someone but like I said the mini looked fun. I think I have pics for this one completed. - Brad,0.0,,,City,11355,,321-868-3238,http://cocoabeachskatepark.com/

Extremely loud to skate, but smooth and solid, this park was a bit more fun than I imagined it was going to be. The obstacles are not exactly small, and it takes a somewhat of an experienced skater to really skate this park with confidence. Obstacles include a very tall bank ramp, with small quarter pipes embedded in it, and extensions; A very wide (16ft.+) and tall (6ft.+) quarterpipe; A very fun, 4ft. tall hip, with two 12ft.+ quarterpipes at a shallow angle, and a common deck; A very large half-pyramid with rails going down each side; And, a few different railslide bars set into the concrete, off to the side, where they wont interrupt the overall flow of the park. This is an optional pay-to-skate park, as they ask for a $3 donation at the gate. When I was there, there was no gate person to give the donation to, so I skated for free. -Bud Stratford",0.0,,,,5956,,,

Community Park,,,Free,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,,No,,,1405 F St.,95616,Davis,"Park terrain: Free concrete park with ramps. Open exclusively for skateboarding 4 to 9 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday; 3 to 11 p.m., Saturday; and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sunday. All participants must have a signed liability waiver form on file, and parents of skaters under age 18 must come to the park to sign the form. A terrible waste of time and space. Beginning with a description, you've got a 5 foot deep salad bowl with rough pavement, metal ""noping"" that barely sticks up, and almost wedge like transitions. One end of this crap shoot opens into the most hilarious snake run you've seen. It is literally 1 foot to 1.5 feet deep, almost unskatable. At the end of this winding snake is another round salad bowl, this one is only 2 feet deep, with a metal lip that doesn't even meet your truck for a little squeak. The park is very old and not worth a trip from anywhere more than 5 minutes away, seriously. I skated there while staying in downtown Sacramento, and that was almost too far at 4 miles. It also features the most ridiculous pyramid you've ever encountered, with near vert at 2 feet tall. The place is almost unskatable. Much like a side of the road drainage ditch with a fence surrounding it. The blip about a waiver and pads is null and void. This park has not been touched or seen by anyone from the parks department since it was built, after they must have realized that it was unskatable and no one would be going there. Unbelievable that parks like this exist. I did have a good time tooling around there though. It is almost a huge challenge to keep your speed in the snake run and slash a little slider on the ""banks"".",0.0,0.0 ,,City,6753,,(530) 757-5626,http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/facility/details.cfm?id=6D611BF6-8EE0-44D9-93EC73C503A1A5C1&type=Park

Concrete Wave Country,,Open,Free,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,,No,CA. Skateparks,CA. Skateparks,2300 Two Rivers Pky,37201,Nashville,"(posted 06/3/2005) Just visited the Nashville, Tennessee park last weekend on the way back from Athens, Georgia. Nashville is a really nice park.  The combi pool feels a little tight at first but is very well done--the coping sounds killer on frontside grinds. The street/bank area is also really cool. You can hit any obstacle from multiple angles, and there's no speed-sucking ""dead"" sections regardless of which way you're going. The flow area has a funky ""sideways washboard"" entrance that takes a bit of getting used to, but after a few runs you get the hang of it. Overall, I'd rate this park about an 8 or 9. It's well worth a visit if you're anywhere near the Nashville area. I'm from St. Louis, about 280 miles away, and I definitely plan to go back again. One big caution: WEAR YOUR HELMET! Locals tell of cops with binoculars scoping the place out for helmetless riders, then cruising up and writing multiple tickets. One further note, FWIW: You have two listings for this park (""Concrete Wave Country"") on your Parks page for Tennessee.  Regards, Jonathan Harms",0.0,,,City,15389,,862-8400,http://www.skatetn.com

I really would recommend this park to kids that love to ride street obstacles. The park is a split-level park, so there's a nice 2.5' gap in the middle that's fun for all sorts of trickery. To give you an idea about the gap, there is a four set down part of it. The surface is beautiful concrete, so it's fast as hell, and the ramps themselves are also fast, so it's pretty easy to build up a lot of speed. However, it isn't hard to run out of a place to go due to the layout of the park. If you're in the area and wanna good place to warm up for some of the real street skating that is available in the city, this park is the place. You're supposed to wear a helmet, and the cops will try and enforce it, so be careful with that.",0.0,0.0 ,,,7305,,,

Coronado Skateboard Park,,Open,Pay,Outside,No,Yes,Concrete,Yes,No,Site Design,CA. Skateparks,2000 Mullinix Dr,92118,Coronado,"This park #@&$#@ rips! At first glance, I didnt know what to expect. In typical California fashion, it is a concrete park without vert...but, once you drop in, it is quite evident that this park is much different than the rest. The lines here are endless...this park is &%$@%* fast!!! The construction of this park is almost perfect...the concrete is flawless. The place is lined with bowls, hips, elevators, and anything else you can think of.  Coronado skatepark located at Tidelands Park in Coronado California was completed in May 2001. SITE Design Groups Landscape Architect/skatepark designer Mike McIntyre designed the skatepark and made countless visits to Coronado, to ensure quality craftsmanship. Much thanks go out to Wally Holladay for his shotcrete work in the clover bowl and the street course.  Enclosed within an area of 16,700 square feet are two amazing bowls and a street course. There is a rectangle/round bowl that has a 5-ft. deep, rectangle shallow end connected to a round, 8-ft. deep end with a rounded hip. The 3-clover bowl is super fun. It has a 5-ft. deep round bowl, connected to a 7-ft. deep round bowl, connected to an 8-ft. deep square bowl with two rounded hips. Both bowls have transfer options. The street course has a four sided, home plate shaped pyramid, fun box with a flat bar across the top, two banked hips, three transitional hips, quarter pipes, three extensions, a bank to wall and a flat bar.  Coronado charges a small fee to skate and requires a helmet and pads. This skatepark is always nice to visit because it's only about 100 feet from the water and just minutes from downtown San Diego. If you are ever in southern California and you like to skate or watch skateboarders do their thing, you got to check this park out.  Cost $5.00 The good: perfect view, concrete, no groms, cute chicks hanging out The bad: no wall over 7 ft high, no vert The bottom line: the best non-vert park i have ever skated Since I only gave Chino an 8, I can only give Coronado a 7. It probably deserves a 7.5.  Pros - scenic, good place to take the family or visiting relatives because they can hang out at the park area while you skate, great weather year round, lots of MILFs and other eye candy, never crowded, two extremely fun bowls with lots of speed lines, great concrete work, always a great vibe with friendly skaters, Sunday morning old guy sessions.  Cons - pay to play, no lights, supervised, pads (helmets are always mandatory, but you can often get away with no pads if you're wearing long pants and a long sleeve shirt), no real vert, shitty street section.  I like Coronado. It's a user-friendly park where you can learn new tricks and not get served up all the time. The staff - some of which actually skate - are very cool and sometimes relax the pad requirements.  - Rated by Takahashi",3.0,0.0 ,,,4936,,619-522-7344,http://www.coronado.ca.us/PDFs/SkatePark.pdf

River front Rd.,86326,Cottonwood,"This Wally Holiday return to the art of skatepark design is a good time for all. The left hand kidney is the centerpiece of the park and it is fun as hell. That doesn't mean its perfect though. Not enough vert = difficulty doing airs or handplants. You can also tell that this was ol' Wally's first (or early) attempt at working with metal coping. Its bonksville in places and nonexistent in others. However, it consistently does not stick up on top which = way hard to ""lock"" into smiths, feebles, 5-O's, etc. The tri-bowl/clover thing is fun, but be prepared to earn your speed lines. The street course has a few good obstacles but there are some ""dead ends"" and lack of planning (i.e. one push run-up for a handrail) On the plus side, the cement is smooth, its free, and the Verde river right next to the park is a prime AZ swimmin' hole.  - Chris Kelley",3.0,0.0 ,,,7242,,,

Medium sized, well built, but overrun with BMXers, this park is tight, but flowing. The shallow horseshoe quarterpipe at the end of the park is a nice design element (that rarely gets used), and the half-bowl looks great, this park also features some novel street elements and unusual quarterpipe features. It's well worth the drive from Indy, and it looks like it might be a great road-trip stop for roving skateboard nomads as well. -Bud Stratford, The Solitary Life",0.0,0.0 ,,,9411,,,

Went southbound for a trip to Port Orford and Brookings last week. Had to  hit up Crescent City since we had not scene the new park. I like the town,  as I usually take my surfboard along. Skate the parks and then surf if I see  a good wave. No good waves this trip and no good skatepark in Crescent City -- Pre-Fab  Crapper!!! What a freakin waste of money and time! I can't believe that an entrenched  surfing community like Crescent City, with Rhyn Noll being in town and  helping to raise the like $200,000 for this trophy to crapdom! I would've thought the old surfer dudes would have at least wanted a better  snake run than Arcata... no waves? Go concrete surfing, but no! Pour a big flat concrete pad and put some four-fout high quarter-pipes and a  pyramid up... some rails, a mock loading dock and skate-designed picnic  table up and all the local businesss owners can tell the local kids to get  lost and go to the skatepark. We found two teens boys there just sitting on the ledge.. No boards even,  just cell phones. All that wide-open space and metal... good receiption!  They pointed me to broken bolts and a hole in the bank wall. The place is  just a couple of months old!!! Is thatt all these pre-fab skateparks are good for? Cover the town's ass by  ""giving"" the kids a skatepark so they aren't out skating in front of the  mall?

Season passes (for non-residents) are $35; daily rates are $5. Also beware: This park is available for RENTALS. If it is rented, that means: It is closed for everyone else for the day. With all these variables, it is probably best to call, before even going over there. The number is 219-661-2271; ask for Jennie Burgess.

Desert Breeze Skatepark,yes,Open,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,Yes,No,,,Durango and Spring Mountain,89101,Las Vegas,"Located at the corners of Durango and Spring mountain at the Desert Breeze park, the new Las Vegas skatepark leaves the veteran skater asking: ""what were they thinking?"" The first thing you see when you approach the park from the main parking lot is the ""A"" bowl. I call it this because from the air it must look like an upper case ""A"", like on the anarchy symbol. Oddly enough this bowl has a combination of too much flat and not enough. The extensions off the main bowl are about 4 feet deep and they taper to 6 in the main section with no flat bottom. The main bowl is too wide and open to maintain speed without pushing and the transitions are such that putting together a good line is very hard. The next item would be a snake run: 3 feet deep and way too tight - maybe 8 feet lip to lip, sharp corners, and extensions. In short It Don't Flow The crowning achievement is what would be a great bowl were it not for the 6 foot nipple that sits where the flat bottom should be. Basically this is a giant bunt cake pan! The designer of this park made the city sign a release when they changed his designs so that he would not be held responsible for what they ended up with. (That should tell you something important) On the Thrasher skatepark chart this puppy is a 2 out of 10. It beats losing money at the casino, but proceed with caution. Those stains on the concrete are not spilt sodas, they are blood. This baby has sent a few to the hospital. - Jim M.",2.7,,,City,8162,,,

Des Moines Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,Yes,No,,,1000 South 219th Street,98198,Des Moines,Des Moines is sort of a street park with little bits of tranny. The best thing it has going for it is one of the funbox. It's a standard eight sided bank design but with a little tranny at the base and at the lip making it extra fast and poppy. On one whole side of the park is a tight four foot wall that is pretty weird but fun when you figure some shit out. On the opposite side there is a three foot wedge in one corner and a right angle two foot trannyed platform which is smooth and kind of fun but whats up with the size. Also there is a marble edged platform and a small table top on the other two sides which are pretty fun too. Check it out if you can get there when there aren't too many kids on fruit boots it's definitely a good skate just for the funbox alone. Another strange skatepark design for Washington but if it wasn't sorta wack it just wouldn't be home now would it.  -J.

The other parts of the bowl vary from three feet to six feet. Every wall in this freak bowl has a little bit of a different tranny. Some walls are quick while others are slower. Amazingly enough the bowl has a good flow. The coping is galvanized steel. The bowl has a spine that is roughly three feet high. Be advised that this area is very windy at times and there are often rocks and pebbles in the bowl. Take a broom to be safe. There is another section of the park that contains a small pyramid, some more tranny, a little but fun hip, a ledge, a rail and maybe a stair or two. It is possible to flow from the bowl to the other area. Most of the time the park is locked up, so you will have to jump the fence to skate. The park is unlocked at about two pm by a pad nanny. The nanny stays till about six pm then locks up again. Most of the locals come before the pad nanny or after the park is re-locked. Pads are required while nanny is on duty. When the nanny is gone anything goes. There is often all types of rolling stock in the park after six. There are restrooms in the park itself, however, they are always locked. Of course its a free park. Although this park is behind the police station, their presence at the park is non existent since they have bigger fish to fry. Nice park, small, fun, small bowl with a nice spine. If you want to skate a fun spine do not miss it, otherwise head directly to Palm Springs.  - Matt B.

Durango Park - Y.M.C.A.,,,Free,Outside,Yes,,Concrete,,,,,3521 N. Durango,89129,Las Vegas,"Yes Vegas has many shitty parks and some so-so parks. It seemed that there for awhile that the city/county was learning from previous mistakes and the parks were gradually getting better, then they do something like this. This park is so far from good it's laughable. So with that said here's my take, it has a wanna be street area that appears that they tried to make ""safe"" by chopping the ledges down to were they are unusable.  It has a serious slope into the 2 bowls that are about 6 feet deep. Those could have been fun but the concrete is brushed finished and the coping is recessed. Then they added a waterfall/pyramid type thing at the top of the bowls but about 1-2 feet back from the ledge, the only purpose for this structure is to make you scratch your head and wonder what that non-skating designer was thinking and how could he feel good about excepting a check for such crappy work. On the positive side, one good thing about the park is that it seems to be a bike magnet. For some strange reason bikers like it and it keeps them away from the other parks here.",0.0,0.0 ,,,7730,,,

They don't point directly at the park, but they mine as well because that's where it all drains anyway.  Pretty good skatepark. It has a few stair sets, bowl, spine, two banana rails, one is low and one is higher. A REALLY long wall with coping. and a bunch of concrete boxes, a pyramid and a funbox. I've seen the cops up there about 5 times to bust bikers cause they hit the little kids and don't give a shit. Don't be a dick to the cops, they WILL arrest you and will have no problem doing so. The only bad thing about this park is that they don't have coping on the bowls and quarterpipes but other than that, fairly good park.

Folsom Skatepark ,,,Pay,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,,Wormhoudt,Wormhoudt,1775 Creekside Dr.,95630,Folsom,"Folsom is a super fun, super smooth, super good park. I skated it 4 times during my stay in Sacramento. It features a giant combi bowl at 10 feet deep, a square bowl to the right, a round bowl to the left, an 8 foot deep middle section that ties to a 6 foot deep left side and a 4 foot deep right side. 4 chambered with round hips, 45's, and 90's. All metal coping. Big extensions in the 4 foot and in the 8 foot middle section. The 8 foot middle one has a channel in the middle, used for entry and for airs over. Really nice design, really smooth and fast. The flow area is fun too, small, but you can launch from the 4 foot deep part right over the platform into the banks of the flow. A few street objects surround the bowl and flow area for the kiddies to railslide and sit on while watching the session. It's only 2 dollars and it is open till 9 or 10 depending on the time of year. Best park in the Sacramento area by far, and only an hours drive from Strawberry bowl, so do a double header if you do the Folsom thing. It is a half hour from downtown Sacramento. N Men are the locals and they are pretty cool.  Little kids are in full effect and some of them rip too. The only problem with the combi bowl is that the 4 foot section is almost always occupied by one or two kids and you can't really fly through there without dodging them. Pool coping would be nice too, but the metal works. Hot as hell in the afternoon, so wait for the after 6 session. Sacramento is in the middle of the desert. (02/20/2004)  Weird hours - 3PM-8PM Mon-Thurs, 3PM to 9PM Fridays, Noon to 9PM Saturdays, Noon to 5PM Sundays. Lights! Best time to skate is at night after 6 when the Magic Minivan sweeps away all the kids (dinnertime). Don't get me wrong, kids are okay, but the sheer volume of inexperienced youth makes anything resembling skating nearly impossible. It's like the advanced level of Frogger out there until they go home.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,6412,,,
Fontana Skate Park,,Open,Free,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,No,CA. Skateparks,CA. Skateparks,16581 Filbert Avenue,92335,Fontana,"Fontana. Home of race tracks, meth labs, smog, great hole-in-the wall Mexican restaurants, and one fine skatepark. Personally, I think Chino is better, and since I gave Chino an 8, Fontana should really be an 8-minus. Go cry me a river if you have any issues with that. Pros - opens early, lights for night sessions, unsupervised, some of the best concrete finish work in SoCal, the clover bowl is speedy fast and it has lots of workable lines, and you're bound to see some of the Sacrifice crew there. Cons - stupid waste of money fingerboard park, pads required, no pool coping, the intermediate bowls are simply a waste of concrete, and it gets a little hot in the summer. Overall, the park has some shortcomings, but I still think that the clover is one of the best bowls in SoCal (even though it's too shallow for most rippers). For you out of town folks, the Fontana-Upland-Chino trifecta should not be missed. M.

Campbell St.,46383,Valparaiso,"5/11/2008 The Valparaiso Skatepark consists of very large, wood and skatelite obstacles that might be better suited to BMXers, than skateboarders- just because of their sheer size.

The park includes: A very sizable hip (at least 5ft. tall); A very tall and wide quarterpipe (about 6ft. tall, and at least 16ft. wide); A long, flat railslide bar; A gigantic fly-ox that is at least 6ft., maybe even 7ft. tall; A large, 6ft.+tall spined quarterpipe; And, another extremely wide quarterpipe that begins at about 3ft. tall, and works up to about 8ft.. -Bud Stratford It is a dope park!

Good place to beat the heat in the summer.. Park has flaws but and can get frustrating like the 4 foot mini with way to much flat... This park features about a 5 foot bank roll-in that rides into a funbox with a rail and ledge. Or you can roll-in from the left and hit a spine and these both go into a 4 foot quarter pipe. If you turn ninety degrees you'll be in kinda of a mini ramp made of two 5 foot quarter pipes. By the bank there is a escalator great for grinding and manualing up. By this there is a rail. To the side of the 4 foot quarter on your left is another 4 foot. The four and five are connected great for ollieing of the five to ground. Then there is a pyramid like S.P.o.T's but with just a ledge. To get over that they have another bank. By this pyramid there is a flat ledge. If you come of the bank go over the pyramid there will be a rail and then turn to your right and there is a higher flat ledge for experienced riders. Go back to the rail and there is a 6 foot mini. To top it all off there is a long kinked rail in the middle of the park. view other parks in Florida,0.0,,,City,8339,,727-893-7756,http://www.stpete.org

Franklin public skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Skatelite,No,No,,,1 Caisson Drive,46131,Franklin,"10/18/2010 A few years back, the town of Franklin was flooded out by some pretty heavy-duty spring rains. In the process, their skateboard park was totally destroyed. Insurance covered a replacement facility... and here it is. These look like ARC-sourced prefab steel ramps, but they are a huge improvement over the previous Rhino-built facility. Also gone is the perimeter fence, which was a nice touch: It eliminates that ""prison yard"" feel that most fenced-in parks have. Everything is well-built, and as far as prefab parks go, it's actually pretty damn fun. -Bud Stratford, The Solitary Life 4/12/2008 This skatepark is located directly beside the Franklin, IN Police Department Headquarters. A few years old, it is beginning to show its age, and fall into a state of minimal disrepair. Repairs are currently underway, which means that a few of the obstacles are off-limits until the work has been completed. The skatepark consists of quite a few street obstacles, strewn about on a very large concrete slab. Built by Rhino Ramps, the obstacles are a steel-surfaced wood core material, covered with Skatelite. The park is tightly packed; there is literally dozens of various quarterpipes, spines, flat banks, half-pyramids, hips, fly boxes, ledges, and boxes here, some of which are put together into some very interesting obstacle combinations (see pics). For what it is; that is, a small-town, budget-minded prefab park, it is not really half bad. Quite fun, actually. The mini ramp is about 6ft. tall and approx. 8ft wide, which makes it virtually useless for anything other than straight, back-and-forth, stationary tricks. It is a great park. There is a lot to do there. It is great for beginners but also has a lot for experienced riders. Check it out you will love it.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,8432,,,

There is a street course that I don't have photos of...I'm an old guy so I don't venture to the street side too much. The bowl is great...it has great lines and transitions, great traction, steel coping (except the deep round bowls have pool coping). I would estimate that at the roll-in in the shallow end the pool waterfalls from 4'-6'-8'-10' with a 2' extension from a 6' section. It's great for beginner to expert skaters. (Bear in mind the depths are estimates...)   Tons of fun. I'll try to get better pics of the pool and some pics of the street section. It's all under snow at the present...   There's also a skate shop out here in Avon, CO called the Board Room with a footie ramp in its back-room. I think the dimensions are 4' tall, 12' wide, 8' transitions, masonite with steel coping. $3.00 for two hours. It's small but a great way to get your skate-jones on when the snow is deep and you need a break from Vail. I'd rate the pool at an 8-9...rating could be higher if there were less waterfalls. But the flow from the roll-in the the deep end is great. Lots of varying line possibilities. Great backside lines for the regular footed skater.   I hope this helps a bit. - Chris",0.0,,,City,4028,,,

Metal coping lines 2 of the clovers, the shallow end and the square deep end. In the last pocket the lip rises up to an over vert pocket and is lined with pool coping. The overt vert in here is pretty mellow and not to hard to grind since the rest of the bowl is about 9 feet deep and easy to generate speed through.  Snake Run: This area is a mixture of a street course, mini ramp, clamshell over vert pocket, a snake run, and a vert basin. This thing is squeezed in between and around the other 2 bowls. At the top end of this there is a bank drop off into a rail, a small mound, gap, or another bank whic all drop you into a pool coping lined tranny wall with a tombstone (left) and channel in the middle. This basin kind of flow down into the snake run where the clamshell lives next to a roll over mound and across from some small hips and lips. If you make it through this spot you're well on your way into the 10ft. deep vert basin. This thing is really tall with pool coping on one side and really short with metal coping on the other. There is a love seat in the middle of the big wall and slanted wall on either end to bowl this thin out. It is pretty freaking sick if you can get a clear shot through the whole thing.  Street: There are a lot of other little ledges and trannies sprinkled around the park. Lots of fun stuff on the back of the over vert pockets and channel trannies. They squeezed in little hits where ever they could. In this small 15,000 square foot park they really crammed in as much as they could and they did a killer job. I am happily going to be calling this place home for a good long while.  This park is a must hit for tranny riders! - J. Greenwood",3.7,0.0 ,15000 square feet.,City,6461,,818-548-2786,

Read all about how they got it built at http://www.greenskatelab.org The place is one big bowl, with real pool coping everywhere. The bowl is about 9ft in the deep side, and 6 ft in the other side. There is a 3-4 ft role over separating the two sides, but it only extends about half way. Then there is a shallow part that is about 3-4 ft deep, with real mellow transition, perfect to learn how to drop in over coping. There was even a deathbox!  The cement work was first rate, considering this was done with all volunteer labor. Very smooth, but not slippery. Better than most commercial work. The coping perfectly set, and rode like butter. These guys kicked butt!  There was so many lines in this place, it was just amazing. The kids in the neighborhood had just started to ride it, and there was a few that were starting to work the bowls. The place in built in a lower middle class DC neighborhood, so most of the kids couldn't afford boards. Every time I'd stop to rest, one would ask if he could ride my board. They were having a blast. Some had boards that were given to them because they had helped in the construction. I was trying to teach them how to drop in (blind leading the blind!). The kids were having so much fun!  I also ran into two Concrete Disciples skating the place, Seth (Letsgoskatepools) and John (Bulldog).",0.0,0.0 ,,,12179,,,http://www.greenskatelab.org

The park in Hailey is COMPLETE and rippable. The park fully flows from the shallow end to deeeeeep end - and I mean deep - ....like 13 feet deep. There also a 14 foot tall vert wall that will send you up and over the pipe. The place is pretty full with young skaters and lots of rookie grommets. The park is right on highway 75, on the south side of town...you can't miss it. I drove 11 hours to skate this place and it's well worth the drive. Best to stay a few days to get the place wired. There are cheap hotels there and spendy ones too. Just don't go during the winter months. I heard stories of the Dreamland guys just tearing the place up. - Matt  This park has another unique feature created by Dreamland. A full pipe that is incorporated into the skatepark where you can roll over the top of it. It's a bit smaller trannied than most built for skating.  Hey, My name is Andy Gilbert. I am sending some photos of the new park in Hailey, Idaho. I have gotten to sample it and holy shit . It is big, fast, fun and a little scary when you roll over the fullpipe. This is another sick park by Dreamland. Looks like the project is about two weeks out. Just in time for our harsh winter and no skating for five months. This park is worth the trip.

Hamilton Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,Yes,Concrete,,No,Wormhoudt,Wormhoudt,1200 Hamilton Parkway,94945,Novato,"1. People are excited and think this park is good, but that is because there are so many shitty skateparks around here to compare it to. If something half decent gets built people are stoked, and this park is exactly that - half decent. Mostly bowls in the 5' range, there are a variety of hips, lines and transfers to do. The biggest wall is 6' but it is far away from the rest of the bowls, and you have to battle the street flyout kids to get to it. The coping is pretty good, but some of the transitions fade at the top, and worst of all, Zach Wormhoudt built it so you know it can't be that good in the end. The basic lines are there but he doesn't quite get it, and the true potential of the design and flow in the bowls were not fulfilled. While it may be one of the better/best free cement skatepark in the Greater Bay Area, it is not all that. 2. A well rounded park with four bowls with perfect transitions and a decent but small street course, the Novato Parks and Rec did a good job. The bowls have great corners, but most of them are 5 feet, with one quarter in the street area reaching 6.5 feet. If you're not too far from Novato (near Marin, SF) check it out, it's worth it. Full Pads Required! We saw at least 10 kids get ticketed, but it was mostly because some other dumb kid was talking back to the Fuzz. - Mike G & Dan K  3. Good for beginners and experts.

It might not have a lot of street but transition is so much better anyway!- kalford 5/25/2007 It has a few good street areas, and three bowls. One of the bowls has the “only over-vert door built” according to a local, another bowl is a left hand kidney with pool coping, the other bowl is in the shape of the state of Idaho. I did not look at the rules but no one was wearing pads and the cops drove by. Pretty rad 8 or 9 out of 10, maybe. It would be 10 out of ten except the door bowl does not have the best flow, the kidney does not have tile and is not as rad as Encinitas and it could use a little more street area. Mind you, 8 or 9 out of 10 is really fun. - George",0.0,,,City,6673,,,

There's lots of lines, lots of speed, not a beginner park, in fact no kids at all, oh yeah bring some beer as well the cops dont care. AWESOME! I hit it up on the Fourth of July, not that any of the Canucks cared, but it was my way of celebrating my own Independence from U.S.A. culture. Vancouver had just had three days of rain, but there was hardly anyone there. In Oregon, especially during the summer months, a park like this would have been packed with little kids. The curvey-snakerun bowls are pretty deep for the little ones to be swimming in, but there is also a streetstyle area behind the main bowls. It basically has something for everyone! There are even ledges and stairs to skate just outside the park. I could not get a positive answer, but I believe the park was built for one of the Slam City contests just a few years ago. The concrete is really smooth and the cooping is in great shape. There are so many hips and corners to hit that you get dizzy trying to figure out lines. WOW!",0.0,0.0 ,,,2418,,,

Everything here is huge; this park is not for the faint of heart. The obstacles include a few really tall, wide quarterpipes; A 4ft. tall, 24ft. wide hip ramp; A few very tall, long, and wide steel boxes; An extremely long, kinked flat bar; And, a massive half-pyramid with very tall rails going down either side. Located in Yeoman Park, this park is not exactly easy to find. Make sure to study the Google map carefully before checking this one out-  Bud Stratford A small skatepark but a lot of lines and tricks can be pulled here. (A very fun park to skate) - Tim G. The parks fun! but it is what it is! straight back and forth, and steel! it was basically built to keep the kids from skating downtown. there was also supposed to be more ramps added as time went by. But we all know how little towns work! it has a 5 & 7 quarters, 3ft hip,4ft. spine, 4ft. quarter built into a 6ft. bank ramp, 2ft. & 4ft. jump ramps with bank landings, a round rail & a box iron ledge on the jump box monstrosity, a long multi-sized rail, two small rails (one of which was stolen) and a multi sized grind box, and another grind box that no one really skates to much! It is a good park to learn or practice tricks, but if you really want to flow, drive the 45 minutes north to Ft.Wayne and skate Lawton Skatepark!!",0.0,,,City,4384,,,

Elm St. and Barnett Drive.,42420,Henderson,"4/18/2010 Henderson, KY has a small little skatepark that consists of [mostly] Skatewave prefab ramps on a [rough] asphalt slab. The park isn't much to look at, and likewise, isn't really much to skate. The good points are, it sits amongst a grove of trees that provide ample shade on bright, sunny days, and the hill is great to watch the ""action"" from. And, the local kids were a pretty nice bunch, too. Kinda made me think that they deserved something better than what they got from the powers-that-be in Henderson's political bullshit. -Bud Stratford, The Solitary Life. An ok park but not the best. Has a 5ft quarterpipe, a funbox, and a bank ramp. Lots of boxes, benches and a ""hill"" rail. Come check it out there is some ok skating happening at this park.",0.0,,,,6409,,,

The clover looks similar to Clairmont to me but with an extra hip thrown in and steel instead of pool coping/tiles. According to the Wally Hollyday design page, A custom guide for trimming along the coping is used for a consistent top edge; it looked pretty clean to me. Plus the one section looks like they are trying to bring ditch skating to UT. Rose Park is almost done as well - they said one week to completion and 3 weeks till skateable.  Brian B.",0.0,,,,7632,,,

Also all the rails and ledges are kept waxed all nice and slippery.

Has some elements of Aumsville, and Seaskate, but is very smooth. The Deepest bowl looks to be about 10 feet deep. And the other bowl looks to be about 8 feet deep, reminded me of Ballard. Fast lines galore in this thing. However, I didn't get to explore all of them due to the kids barging in unexpectedly.  There's a cool snake run leading to the Ballard sized bowl. The shape of the deeper bowl is a little different. And took a little to figure out, but it wasn't bad, just different.  The Skate Track. Well, there's this Orcas like skate track that runs around the outside. It was gnarly. Not because of the track, but because of the thousands of kids to wade through, just to run it. The skate track intersects with about three different mini ramps, and one street area. So, when I decided I was going to get a run on this track. I had 5 aborted tries before I successfully made it around. And even then, I was dodging boards, kids, and even bikes.  Over all, this is a fun park. Lots of kids are going to rip, there's lots of kids in the area, and the city just gave them something positive to do with their lives. The kids were facinated with the deep bowls. They will be learning it in no time. I wish I had something to skate like this in my city when I grew up.  - Dan H.  12,000 Square Feet. Two center bowls 10 feet deep. 6 foot - 7 foot snake run connecting the bowls to the outer snaketrack containing a series of mini-bowls, pyramids, and ledges. A row of ledges, rails, and funboxes provide an enclosure rim around the park.  Grindline crew did a killer job here. The 2 bowls in the middle of the park are sweet. There is a nice snake run that flow all around the park, with diferent sections and corners. There ae afew ledges around and lot of flat areas, a rail or 2 and a woopdydoop bump.

It's got a small box/manual pad, a round handrail, a vert wall, and some kind of weird ledge thing that kids usually do tricks off of, but I've seen some people go up it or go up the tranny and grind it. All in all, this park isn't half bad. I go there almost every day for a year and a half, and I'm still not over it.

The park has also just celebrated its 2nd birthday this month (July 2012). The bowl is 1.4m and 1.7m deep with a 300mm extension in the deep end. There is a mini ramp at 1.1m high and 3.6m wide and a minimini ramp at 0.8m high and 2.4m wide. The company that made the bowl and the ramps did a really good job with the limited space they had to squeeze it into the unit. The minis are small but still fun to skate and after you work out the lines in the bowl you can fairly rip around. The guys that built it are   and they built the Nike (miyashita) skatepark in Tokyo. There is a convenience store 2 minutes walk away and the usual drinks vending machine right outside with the local super market just 10 minutes walk away for a bigger variety of food. All the locals are really friendly and there are a lot of visiting skaters from various teams and shops from around japan all the time. Once a month on a Sunday there is a beginners group on a Sunday till 1pmish and sometime a shop will book out the whole morning. Apart from arriving first in the morning there is usually always another skater there and some even come for a skate in their lunch time. The only down side for some people maybe that helmets are compulsory and if you don't have one on you, you can rent. Here is the   before the extension was added. I'm in there about 1:55 Finding the place is fairly simple and if your in the Nagoya area well worth the visit. The only down side is that it does get hot in the summer so best to take some water with you.",0.0,0.0 ,,Private,3959,,japan 052-622-583,http://www.hunterspointsb.com/shop/index.html

Pock marks, craters, chunks missing near the coping, you get the idea. 2) The tranny in the horseshoe (a ½ bowl ranging in height from 3 to 5 feet) was a bit mellow, making it difficult to maintain speed. 3) There was too much flat ground. 4) On Saturdays, parents like to bring their toddlers into the place on little pink scooters and basically get in the way. Not good. Good news: 1) While the bowl is a mess to look at, the craters and such are not enough to cause a slam (just make a little noise and slow you down a bit) and the tranny is pretty fun, even with the generous flat middle and weird 2-foot shallow end. It could be a lot faster, but it is more skatable than it looks, especially if you are running 60mm or bigger wheels. 2) The crete in the rest of the parks is nice 3) The place is loaded with fun banks and hips. 4) The locals are cool and some of them were killin it!  By day three I found myself anxious to get back to this place to learn more lines. I ran into a lot of the same kids and dudes each day and they were all really nice. I have heard the park in Sparks (Burgess) is the call in terms of good tranny and good crete in this area but it was a hassle for me to get there. If you are staying in the city and do not have a car (or time to drive around), this park is definitely worth the skate from downtown.  -Bryon R.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,5554,,,

There is a little street section with a 4 foot quarter and a three foot brick quarter as well, a hubba down a five or six stair, two metal L'd benches and a baby flat bar. There is also a knee high pole jam and they are all set up with a good flow around the bowl for all the tech dudes out there. The bowl is pretty fun, It think it is mostly 3 foot walls with two 5 foot quarter pipes and an open face cradle which gets up to about 6 feet. Really good flow and super smooth cement and some manly coping so it's easy to keep your speed and lock into some grinds.

And then there is something no skatepark is complete without...the infamous four stair accompanied by a very small square rail. Over all its a pretty fun park and you can carve for hours. Its also cool because you can carve some bowls, hit some ledges and rails and carve more! bowls without pushing once. Every body knows everybody at the park. There's some party stores within walking distance in both directions. No pads or helmet required.

Jefferson St,60431,Joliet,"The small footprint of the park and the load of large ramps it boasts makes for a crowded and compact feeling. The park has two levels (all concrete and steel) with small ramps, stairs and ledges leading from the lower level to the upper level. The upper level is bordered on three sides by long grindable (and sit able) benches which embrace a square box/tabletop, a flat grind rail, and an angled ledge which overlooks the halfpipe below. The lower level contains said halfpipe which shouldered by some large flat ramps on one side and a smaller ramp and ledge on the other. The flat ground on the lower level consists of two grind rails (one angled, one level), a large quarter pipe (positioned opposite the flat ramps by the halfpipe,) an angled table top, and a large roll-in. The park is fun to skate as long as you can get speed, because all the ramps are fairly big. The ledges are imposing as most are tall and angled. All the surfaces are polished, so things can get slippery and rain water has a hard time doing anything but pooling in all the most inconvenient places for days. There is a soda machine but water (and bathrooms!) from the recruiting station adjacent is just as good if you can sneak past the soldiers. Overall, it's a nice place.

Interskate Park,,,,Outside,,,Mixture,,,,,Linden Ave and Park Street,43701,Zanesville,"(updated 7/7/05) i'm sorry to say Interskate has gone to complete shit. the city gave up on trying to keep the bikers out - ghetto kids kept cutting holes in the chain link fence... so they now ""allow"" bikes in. the problem is, the kids who ride bikes in our town don't give a hoot about upkeep of the ramps or trash or the ramps themselves.. they constantly move the ramps around and the bank ramps have been removed by the city because of structural damage. all but one of the ramps are now missing the metal at the bottom of the transition.. the bikes don't care because they can roll over the bump but it'll catch skateboard wheels easily. the funbox is now missing the vertical wall - kids ripped it out. the top of the box is caving in due to two million fly outs and hard landings from kids on bikes. the mini ramp has developed a lot of holes in the riding surface and the decks are chewed to shit from bike pegs. the only thing really worth hitting anymore is the wading pool (ie: the ""bowl"") - the bikes can't do much to it besides bad graffiti and tags.. they do manage to track a lot of dirt in there from riding through mud puddles immediately before entering the park.. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, I thought you should update your site perchance someone from out of town was planning a roadtrip. much better to just head to columbus (an hour west) to hit the new Powell or Westerville skateparks (outdoor, cement, free) or south an hour or so to hit Athens in all it's gnarly glory. jason bash This park is fun as hell. The main feature is the 4' deep square concrete bowl that they've got sunken into the blacktop surface. It's fun, but not as fun as it should be. There is no coping, then transition is a bit too mellow, and the corners are almost impossible to carve. If you like to do fly-outs, this bowl kicks ass. If you wanna carve and grind...it's so-so. However, the park does have one of the best mini-ramps I've ever skated. Calling it 4' high might be a bit of a stretch, but that's what I'm going to say. It's skatelite, and fast as all hell, plus the surface is black, so if it rains, wait ten minutes for the sun to come out, and the session is back on. There are also many ""street"" ramps at the park. Quarterpipes and bank ramps and a nice pyramid/funbox ramp in the center of the park. It's all skatelite and black, so the drying factor applies to them as well. The locals are down to skate with anyone, and they rip the place to shit. !

Nothing wrong with it but nothing amazing. Good mini ramp about 5 feet tall, take off ramp, pyramid bump, quarterpipe, manual pad, flat bar rail. The park is in a nature reserve that is really beautiful. There are walking trails, swingsets, baseball fields, an inline hockey rink, bbq areas in the woods,etc. Not someplace to go out of your way to skate, but a cool place to take the family for a picnic and get a skate in too.

Irwindale Skatepark,,Open,Free,Outside,Yes,,Concrete,,No,,,5051 N Irwindale Avenue,91706,Irwindale,"There is a new skatepark that is almost done in Irwindale. It has a tear drop shaped bowl that looks like a lot of fun and it looks quite deep. I couldn't tell exactly how deep it was, since the park was fenced off. The park is completely poured, looks smooth, has lights. It looks like all they need to do is pave the parking lot and the park should be good to go. I checked it out this morning after skating Duarte with Guy and these two other cool skaters that told us about Irwindale and gave us directions on how to get there. Besides the tear drop shaped bowl, the park is small, has a street course that has a back to back set up, is cluttered, and looks like it doesn't have much flow. The tear drop shaped bowl looks like it will be good fun. - Matt B.",3.7,0.0 ,,City,3882,,91706,

The ""swami coping"" (cement) is awesome. The launcher thing is good to get some ollie to grinds or tails. The little pyramid is pretty tight and not very useful. The overall flow can keep you moving non stop for a quite a while. I can't wait to see this one get the rest of itself finished. Rumor has it they are trying to raise some more money.  Amenities:  It's free, and outdoors. Helmets are required. Restroom and drinking fountains are nearby as well as some decent looking restaurants and bars. Jacksonville~(3/16/99)  This skatepark is pretty nice, hard to explain. It's located up a mountain kinda, so when you're riding there it feels like you are in the middle of freakin' nowhere, it's weird. I guess it's worth checking out, but the drive from I-5 will set you back a good 1/2 hour or so.

Jeffersonville Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,No,No,,,2107 Middle Road,47130,Jeffersonville,"8/23/2010 The Jeffersonville skatepark is a smallish, all-concrete skatepark that sits right next door to the city's Aquatic Center on the far east side of the city. It features a half-bowl, as well as several ""street"" obstacles of varying types and build quality. I've gotta be honest with ya: Some of the stuff in this park just didn't make any sense whatsoever... and overall, it looks like a mighty challenge to try to skate it. It's also fairly overrun with BMXers. But if you're already in the Louisville area, and you're up to something a bit on the ""gnar"" side, the Jeffersonville park is only about ten minutes away.

On the set of a former trailer park loop, the land was donated by Tim Harvey, a local developer after the trailer park flooded in 1999. So the set up of the park is a 600 foot long 16 foot wide L. Many people have been involved in building ramps in the past 10 years. Most notably Greg Fatigate, Isaac Graham, Josh Lemieux, Cody Hill, Howard Romero and Richie Bowen. The park features mostly transition, but we've dedicated a little over a 3rd of the space to developing a street area. Also located at the park is one of the finest sets of dirt jumps in the state for all you biker dudes. We've also got a grill, a graff wall, running water, boards and parts for sale, and plenty of space for the kids and dogs to run around. Ramps include: 6' quarter with an 18"" extension, all pool coped. double camel hump jersey barrier quarter 16' wide spined mini with hips connecting each half to the ""street"" course bi level table top with hubbas, a wall ride, and a flat ledge with a wallie on one side and tranny on the other china bank with buttery landscaping brick coping 3 foot spine with a taco bell roller 19' wide ""BIG O"" replica quarter with a 3 foot doorway and flat concrete coping pole jam 16' wide pyramid hip other various boxes, ledges, manual pads etc. All things considered, the vibe, the location, and the ramps, it's the best skate park in the state, and the potential is nowhere close to being reached.

You'd never know there's a skatepark there, just by looking at the place (because it's clean, tidy, well-built, well-maintained, and mellow, unlike a lot of indoor parks that I've visited...). But, once you step inside... yowzers. The place is owned and operated by a longtime skater that really knows his shit (Glenn Davidson), and his lovely and uber-friendly wife (Sheena). I spent about three hours there, just taking it all in... it's well worth the drive from anywhere in the tri-state area to check this place out. -Bud Stratford/The Solitary Life",0.0,,,City,7619,,(812) 402-2940,http://www.killerskatepark.com

Klamath Falls Skatepark,,Open,Pay,Outside,No,No,Concrete,Yes,No,Dreamland,Dreamland,4500 Foothills Blvd Klamath Falls,97603,Klamath Falls,"Klamath Falls has one of the best skateparks in Oregon for sure. Particularly for tranny riders and pool coping. There are 5 bowls and three of them have pool coping!!! 2 bowls have serious vert. There's a snake run with a few street elements sprinkled in it and a really small beginners area and punk wall at the top of the monster bowl.  : It seems about 300 feet long and tipped from a 3 foot high roll in area and goes down hill to a 14 foot high monstrous wave (concrete wall) with metal coping. One side down the has a long middle sized transition with a pocket and hip. The opposite side has some large concrete lumps which are quite fun to carve on and useful for speed checking or pumping. On top of the lumps (on the bowl decking area), not to waste any space, there's some woopty-doo's and a snowboarding type kicker. I found this bowl to be supremely smooth and in the realm of speed wobbles at every pass through it. The huge size also made it really easy to blast airs out. I managed some of the best airs I have ever done in that thing.  : This bowl is about 5 feet deep shallow end and 8 feet in the deep with a standard waterfall and a small hip pushed out of one side between the two. All pool coping! Easy to ride and excellent finish.  : This bowl design is totally unique and at first you'll scratch your head wondering what the hell you'll do in this thing. We had a killer couple sessions in it and many got their first grinds on the over vert pocket. It's all deep (about 9 or 10 feet) and there's no ladder to get out. There's a tiny spill way for rolling in which whips you into the bowl in a hurry. Great stuff and the most challenging bowl in the park.  : This bowl got the most usage when we visited and is definitely a good bowl. It's got a large round deep end that is about 7 feet deep and it is about 2/3's the whole bowl. Hips on both sides of the round and atop the waterfall turn into quick little side pockets. Those side pockets both hip into tight corner pockets. Really tight and steep make for some good double truck grinders, but you can also thrown in some slashers or stand up grinds. Between those two corner pocket is one more just like the others. They are all connected by the same sized hips, about 4 feet high and almost vert.  : An easy bowl was thrown in for good measure. It's a snowman bowl about 4-5 feet deep with no coping. This is good for beginners to learn how to drop in and get some basic tricks and carves started.  : The builders made a few street elements and sprinkled them throughout the skatepark around the bowls and snake run. There's ledges, banks, mounds, a punk wall, hips, and quarter pipes to skate around on. The basics are covered but no outstanding street features to be found.  The park is free to ride. There is a parking lot where there are snack and drink machines, water, and bathrooms. No lights and no shade. This place gets hot in the summer!!! Local shop owner Steve from Ride-On skate shop was there with his daughter Weasel when we went. They introduced us around and showed us some lines, so the locals seemed really cool. There is also an international airport in Klamath Falls in case you want to fly in for a quicky!!!  - J. Greenwood",4.3,,,City,8716,,541-850-9571,

Anyway, Tinley park has the Chicago areas newest indoor park, and it's pretty fun. The street area is awesome, layout and flow, lots of boxes, slides, slopes, wallride ramps, etc.. The bowl is pretty fun too. It is only 6 feet deep, but it has a hip and a 70 degree corner, as well as an escalator up and down another 6 inches around a corner. It is built by Plywood Benders, and apparently they know what they are doing. It was not very big, but big and steep enough to blast over the hip in either direction (unlike that super mellow hip in Berkeley CA). Most of the guys there skate it like a mini ramp but they should learn eventually that there are corners. I wouldn't go so far as to say it is one of the best in the area, but it is in the top 4. As a matter of a fact, my preferences for the Chicago area are as follows and in this order: Wilson Beach/Chicago, Whiting/Indiana, 4Seasons/Milwaukee, Tinley Park/Illinois... and the other crap if you're extremely bored, or content with skating on asphalt with ramptech garbage.

This free park is open at 6am to 10 pm and  obviously has lights. Pads are required however are rarely enforced since  there is no pad nanny. The bowl is about 6 feet deep in the not so deep end  and 4 feet deep in the shallow. Most of the bowl has galvanized steel coping  and part has no coping. There is a pre fab pyramid slash not so fun box  (brought from the og la quinta park). There are no quarter pipes or ramps to  get speed from to access the thing. There is a flat bar near the bowl and a  low picnic table for the tech dogs. Also a lauch/spine prefab ramp about 2'  high. During the morning and school hours are the best times to skate there.  After school hours and at night there are a million snot nosed biker kids at  the park. The bowl is fun, fast and smooth but not that challenging. It was  built by CA skateparks and I am not sure who designed it. Well, this is a pretty good skate park just to hang out at. there a little bit for everyone, mostly for the beginners and intermediates. Over in one corner of the park is two quarter pipes about 5-6 ft tall that are about 15 ft apart and makes for a farily nice mini-halfpipe. however there are many complaints about the oversized coping. As far as rails, there's three. one that is pretty cool, it starts out as a low rail about a foot off the ground, but then has an incline to part that goes up to about 2 and half feet or so. Another rail is a square tubed rail that sits about a foot and half off the ground and has some decent length to it. The last is cool to think about but not very usable. Its a round rail that like a 1/4 of a circle and is about 10ft long or so. Okay, that last part is the ramp trio thing they've got going on the opposite side of the mini-halfpipe. its a two pyramids side-by-side, one that is about 2 ft tall and the other about 4 ft tall. the ft one as a quarter pipe on one side and a ramp with a rail on the other, however the quarter pipe makes it almost impossible to board slide the rail. the small pyramid doesn't the same but with no rail. On one side of the dual pyramid thing is two different quarter pipes side-by-side, and on the other side is a long but shallow ramp with a place to stand on top. It's free, unsupervised, and has wooden ramps all around, and I've never seen the pad requirement enforced which is always a plus in my book. All in all, when it isn't a circus over there, its a fun place to hang out if you enjoy street and mild vert.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,6604,,,

Laguna Niguel Skateboard Park,,,Pay,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,No,CA. Skateparks,CA. Skateparks,Alicia Pkwy and Aliso Creek Road,92677,Laguna Niguel,"""Wally Holiday"" designed park. A Lucky Three-Leaf clover bowl (5-6ft deep with a vert+extension section) tucked down in the deep end caps off this bowl-lover's buffet! There are an assortment of ledges, boxes, and rails for the street set, but the main attraction will be all the big-bad trannys and smooth-finished bowls, rollers, and extensions. Kiddie-sized bowls and rails at the top of this kinda small park provide reason for tykes to stay away from the big-dog zones. However, the number of obstacles and features may be a little too closely positioned for their size in this space. Street-flippers have their own little bowling alley-way with ollie-ledges, seemingly designed to keep stray boards (one hopes) out of the deep end bowls. We'll have to see when the gates swing open, hopefully soon! Heard rumor of one-time skater application fee ($25?), but the park has overhead night lights and probably will feature a snack bar, music, and on-site potties when completed. Park has a Big Mean looking fence designed to repel the late-night commandos, and this park will probably have full pad rules tightly enforced by the predictably harsh monitors... Hope this place gets going with a cool open vibe and not too uptight by the operators... ROCK ON! PUNKASS!  No snack bar, as previously mentioned. Parking lot is still under construction. This park will have ""registration"" fees: $20 for locals, $30 for non-locals.  I'd actually give Laguna Niguel a 7+ or an 8-rating. It features a fun vert clover bowl, a mini flow course, lots of good street obstacles, and a good measure of tranny obstacles.  Cons - pay to play; strict supervision; photo ID cards required; big time prison look and feel with gates, fences, and pad nannys on the loudspeakers; crash up derby when it's crowded; poor design results in the ""street"" skaters crowding the bowl entry point.  Pros - neat and clean; spectator bleachers and an upper deck; tons of fun when the flow area is uncrowded; unique bowl shape creates challenging lines; lights.  My initial review of this park was harsh because at the time they didn't allow drinks, videos, or pictures in the park. WTF?!!? Well, the city saw the light and changed those ridiculous policies.  Make no mistake, Laguna Niguel is a solid park. Very much worthy of a road trip that includes Etnies and/or Vans Orange, both of which are relatively close.  - a Takahashi review -",3.7,0.0 ,,City,4708,,949-916-7766,http://www.ci.laguna-niguel.ca.us

The transitions are good, the coping is good, the layout is good, but the size is lacking once again. Nothing to shred over 5 maybe 6 feet tops. So it's a great park for beginner to intermediate riders. It's free, concrete, outdoors, and at least helmets are required, maybe more! I'll make this review short and sweet. Skip this park and head to Laguna Niguel instead. Laguna Niguel is just a few miles down the same road. Laguna Hills is free, unsupervised, and the pad requirements seem to be rarely enforced. It's very small, and it has some street obstacles and a small bowl area - maybe 4-5 foot deep at best. Pink concrete - way punk rock! Major crash up derby factor when it's crowded. This place is good as a warm up for Laguna Niguel, but that's about it. I wouldn't make a special trip to skate it. - reviewed by Takahashi -",3.0,0.0 ,,City,2832,,,

The slab itself is developing some huge cracks in the surface, and Lamasco isn't exactly sitting in a ""choice"" neighborhood, either. It's in a heavily industrialized, old part of town, and the park (obviously) has graffiti all over the place. The ramps themselves are in fine enough shape... they're durable, so they're skateable... but, they're set up all kinds of weird, and the designs are a little bit wacky. Probably great for little kids that are just figuring it all out, or old-ass barneys (like me) that stick to the 3' quarterpipes (on 60mm wheels)... -Bud Stratford, The Solitary Life.

Laurel Skatepark,,,Free,,,Yes,,,,,,10301 Hungary Spring Road,23059,Glen Allen,"(1/10/2008)  It has 4 sections: street course, white bowl, halfpipe, bowl. The bowl is a basic square with rounded corners, but in the middle there is a island and one side has a bump (boob) in it. The bowl is does not transition to well but is still skateable, it goes from a steep tranny to about 2 feet of vert. The halfpipe is very good and around 10ft. tall. It is made from blue metal and is a long enough for 2 people to skate it. The street course consists of: long round rail, bank (metal), crappy one side pyramid hip( barely skateable), a double box, flybox with box on it, then 2 qps. The ground is asphalt and the ramps are made from blue metal. There is also a launch ramp that is moved around the park. The last section is a small 3 set with a flat hubba only 4 inches high or less. Then there is a curving qp/bowl thing which is white and starts around 1 foot and gets up to 4-5 foot. The qp/bowl thing is also a ledge all the the way around which can be skated. At the end of the qp/bowl there it is basically a wallride and the beginning dropping in is like droppin in a 3 set qp. Then there is a blue qp in this section also. This park is definitely not the best especially because of how easily you can be kicked out. Cross one section from the other without picking up your board...out of there. Sit down on a obstacle when the park is empty...out of there. Also braking any of the simple rules for example: chewing gum, taking off pads, cursing, food or drink in side the park and you will have there famous 15-45 minute time out of the park. If you are with your family here there are bleachers partially shaded by a tree for people to watch you. There is also a playground and baseball field there. Bathrooms are located about a 1 minute walk through the baseball field and there is a water fountain at the skatepark. The skatepark has a small gap on the side which you are allowed to skate depending who is working there. If you are in the area it is worth the extra 20-30 minutes to find a better park, but if you do not mind pads and want to visit go ahead. Do not be disappointed if you are looking for some good street action though. - Kathy This park has a pretty decent half pipe, with a fairly large kidney shaped bowl. It has 2 street courses that include a rail funbox, and about 4 quarterpipes. Admission is free, but you have to wear all the pads you can think of. Give it a Try. My directions might be off a bit, so check out the website.   Welcome to Laurel Skate Park! Laurel Skate Park has expanded its free skate area by 6,700 square feet and added additional ramps and even some rails. This addition opened in the Spring of 2000. This only complements the current half-pipe, bowl and free skate area. So get your skateboards, in-line skates or BMX/Freestyle bikes and give it a try. The Skate Park is open to all ages and admission is free. The facility is located at 10301 Hungary Spring Road near the intersection of Old Staples Mill and Hungary Road. Participants are required to wear helmets, elbow and kneepads, wrist guards, shirts and shoes. Shin guards are required for bike riders.

If it's open. Apparently, the local parks dept. is sometimes a little slack on getting it open on time... the many patched-up holes in the chain-link fence are a testament to a skaters' willingness to get into a skatepark and skate, regardless of the efforts involved. The park itself is pretty big, and widely spaced, allowing ample thinking and set-up time between obstacles... it's well-maintained, and there's a few nice shade trees around for those stuffy Indiana dog days of summer.

Lincoln Park Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,,No,Site Design,,2725 Main St.,97116,Forest Grove,"(03/25/2004) - to the extent I want to street skate I want to skate this park. Plazas are the future of street skating in skateparks. Designer: SDG with local input Builder: Local contractor Oops: The finish seemed unnecessarily rough in places. All the same, there is no question real street skating is not always (if ever) so smooth as your standard Dreamland park, so having finishes of mixed grades brings the concept closer to the real thing. The one quarterpipe's reveal appears and disappears; not set well.  Yays: This actually feels like street skating. Ample space between elements is welcome. Some edges are coped, some are not. Vegetation in planters is a great touch. Things are proportioned as you'd find in your average street scenario.  One observation: the park was packed when I was there and the element that saw the most use was... guess... the quarterpipe. I chuckled with satisfaction, knowing that even the most ardent street dogs cannot ignore the appeal of tranny. I asked a couple Koston wannas about their thoughts on the design. They loved it. Much better for them than Newberg, for instance, they offered. That seems fair. Ask me to compare the two and I'll take Newberg every time because of my own preferences.  All in all I'd say Forest Grove represents an important step in Oregon's skatepark progress- the first good street terrain. Now, if somebody could finally get around to doing a whole mess of DL-quality tranny with vert and oververt, and a whole mess of plaza we'd finally have something resembling the baseball field with all the bases and the outfield. Wow- a complete skatepark, what a concept. Forest Grove has room for a couple bowls. But I think we've seen what that town has to offer for the time being. The complete skatepark opportunity may be Portland's.  Tom Miller Skaters for Portland Skateparks http://www.pdxskaters.org",0.0,,,City,6471,,,

It's got a bowl that's S-shaped and goes from 4' to 6' to 9' and 10', but the vert is iffy in spots- certainly not three feet. It's one at best but overall it's quite fun. As is usual with Wormhoudt designs, the ""street"" features are on the perimeter and difficult to access with speed...

Logan Skate Park,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,,,Site Design,Site Design,600 W 500 S,84321,Logan,"This park is considered the best in the state by everyone I talked to. It's a nice park; smaller than Sandy, but definitely better. There are some big walls that go up to vert. The highest wall in the bowl is about 8' high. There are a couple horsehoe-type square bowls that you can roll into with speed; one is about 7' high, the other is about 5' high. The latter is separated from the enclosed bowl by a spine. The closed bowl is sort of trippy. It is square (no big, round bowls in this park, only big squares) and elongated. The shallow can be skated like a mini-ramp. I had a hard time finding any carving lines through the bowl, but there was one local guy that was absolutely killing it. He had no pads and no shirt, so he said he was taking it easy, but his big airs over the hips and gnarly transfers said otherwise. So the place can definitely be skated well. If you like square bowls, this place is for you.  The city takes pride in this place and is thinking of expanding it. (They are strict about keeping bikers out, because they don't want them chipping up the 'crete.) While I was there they had a convention of city officials from all over Utah and Las Vegas come by to look at the park to get ideas for parks to be constructed in the future. (The guy from Vegas was candid about the fact that the parks there are not very good.)",0.0,,,City,6360,,,

The skatepark there is not that bad and it has a lot of people who use it. It contains what you see in the picture above + a large quarter-pipe ( where I shot the photo's above from). Also, there is a really mellow snakerun that winds down a 20ft. poop hill. The hips are about as flat as a drive way but there are good pockets for doing laybacks and Berts if you can get into that sort of thing.

Major Taylor,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,Yes,No,,,W. 38th Street and Cold Spring Rd,46228,Indianapolis,"4/16/2008 The Indianapolis public skatepark is on the same property as the Major Taylor Velodrome - thus, it is typically referred to as Major Taylor Skatepark. Its located south of 38th Street on Cold Spring Rd. On Indianapolis near west side, it is also visible from (but, not easily accessible to) I-65. Major Taylor is a medium-sized, concrete skatepark that is most like a broken-up bowl, with random street elements thrown in between. It features: The skatepark is regularly re-painted, due to almost constant tagging.  The coping has a 6in. steel tile area welded onto it, on all of the transitions, to minimize peg damage from bikes. The park is best skated on weekday mornings, as afternoon and weekend crowds can get pretty out of hand. The park is only open from dawn to dusk, but lights at the park actually allow for 24/7 skating most of the time.  -Bud Stratford",0.0,,,City,12788,,317-327-8356,http://www.indygov.org

Main St.,46901,Kokomo,"5/22/2016, Re-opened recently 4/16/2008 DKs is a long-standing Kokomo fixture, having been in business for nearly 20 years. DKs is set in what appears to be an old, two-story factory building.  The downstairs houses the skate shop and the approx. 4ft. tall x 16ft  wide mini ramp. The mini ramp has a very narrow, 1ft. extension on one corner. The upstairs is where you will find the rest of the skatepark. Very small, very tight, and very crowded, most of the obstacles are about 5ft. tall or so. Every nook and cranny of the space has something to skate, and the entire space is probably less than 2000 sq. feet. Members pay $5 to skate; non-members pay $7. First-time skaters must sign a waiver, and the first-time fee is $12.  -Bud Stratford",0.0,0.0 ,,Private,6889,,,http://www.facebook.com/mainstreetskatepark

All of these ramps are gradually wearing away and falling apart.

The launch is placed in the corner with about ten feet of run-up, and the is inconveniently placed right in front of the funbox.

Marshall Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,No,No,,,1538 East Vest Street,,Marshall,"(1/13/06) The local contractors are not ""complete retards"", they are actually pretty amazing.  Construction was halted for about a year, give or take a couple months, due to local politics (park director vs. park board, allocation of funds, etc). Since then, the project has continued to move forward. Construction of a terraced wall, to preserve the existing dirtwork, has recently been completed. This has allowed concrete work to start again. With completion of the park expect decent square footage, a lot of quarter pipe, and all the standards: pyramid, ledges, etc. Look forward to considerable progress during the 1st quarter of 2006 (weather permitting). Technically the skatepark is a still a construction site and no skateboarding is allowed, however, park staff and the contractors are very cool and friendly and as long as you cause no problems, they don't care about people skating. This park could end up being the most unique and fun park in mid-missouri. This park is no where near finished, so far some of it is amazing and the rest of it is total crap, it has this sweet 40 foot wide vert wall with like 5 foot tranny its so quick its fun, then it has to inclines in a row basically like a couple six stairs with plenty of run way in between,the first slope has hubbas on each side and a round hand rail in the center (absolute perfect measurements) and the second slope has hubbas on each side as well, the design of the park looks decent but the local contractors are complete retards and its not supposed to be complete until 2007",0.0,,,City,5531,,(660) 86-7128,http://www.marshallmoparks.net/skatepark.html

Marysville Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,Yes,No,,,10th Street and Columbia Ave.,98270,Marysville,"  Really really good. Were talkin' best park in Washington. One word, street! its all street. nice everything. A double set, a three stair followed by a four stair, a nine stair with rails and ledges that are super nice. All you could wish for. This park is good for beginners as well as veterans of the sport. living next to this park is a blessing. and i would rather go to this sweet park then sit in traffic 2 hours only to pay a wopping price to get into rain city to only skate for a couple of hours before you get kicked out. I choose the free no hassle park any time. - sk8er_punk2046   The skatepark in Marysville,Washington is an awesome skatepark! Most of the locals are really cool. I used to live by the park and I would walk the 5 min. there each day. It rocks. Ollie down the 9 stair is awesome. Go down the bank next to the fun box and then hit the box and you get major speed. The park is great for every level of boarders. If you need help just ask around for Vean, He is like 10 or 11 and is just as good as as most of the guys there. It is totally worth the drive to it. It is fun to watch what other guys can do. It's right next to a batting cage and mini golf course and behind the laundry mat place and a bowling ally; Strawberry lanes. The only bathrooms is a stupid port-a-potty. Check the park out when you have some free time.  -sk8r chick",0.0,,,City,4207,,,

The grand opening is set for Thursday, January 29th at 3:00PM. The Keyhole bowl will open as is for the opening ceremony. It will be re-done at a later time. They are expecting some of the old Del Mar Skate Ranch locals to be out for this one! So be sure to bring your cameras and witness some history. It will be like 1985 all over again.  M-F - 10 to 5 Sat. - 9 to 5 Sun. - 11 to 4 (posted 2/29/04) My review of Memorial Skatepark is tainted because the pool, which had so much potential during the design stages, was screwed up by the builders. The pool is about 10 feet deep, has no vert, and has a kinked 10 foot transition. It also has a metal plate in lieu of pool tiles, what's up with that? Anyway, if the pool is re-done by CA Skateparks, then it will be great . . . a little boring, but sized to accommodate continuous carving, half-pipe style, and channel airs.  The street area looks pretty sick to me. Stairs, hubba ledges, a curved ledge, rails, a pyramid that in my opinion is too big and too flat, a cool little flat gap to ollie over, some flat banks, and some big steps designed to emulate some famous street spot (in SF I believe). The best tranny in the park is located in the street reservoir - an 8 foot tall quarter pipe with pool coping. That's a nice touch to give the street skaters a taste of poolriding. The street area funnels into a reservoir that is surrounded by small tranny with steel coping. The other side of the street reservoir leads to a ""kiddie"" bowl that has small tranny, metal coping, and a steep volcano. They should have put that volcano elsewhere, but nobody's perfect. Another nice touch to this park is the small skating area outside of the fences. This area has some ledges and very small quarter pipes.  The ""snake"" run resembles the bowls at Ocean Beach, but it has some taller sections that funnel into a 7 foot bowl. No vert, but it has metal coping all around, some rounded hips, some squared hips, and escalators. This was fun to skate, and good for brushing up on the miniramp skills. The lack of height is a downer, as is the fact that it runs uphill from shallow to deep.  Pay to play . . . 5 bucks a day or 30 bucks a year. This really sucks for the local kids, because this park is in a relatively lower income neighborhood, and I'm sure many of them can't afford the fee. I'm sure many of the local kids can't even afford a skateboard. If you're in the 'hood and feel charitable, donate your old gear and you'll generate some good karma.  PS - the staff person said that they plan to keep the bowl for awhile before destroying it. I call BS on that, and think that the city should hold the contractor responsible and get it fixed ASAP. It's an absolute shame - the bowl is skateable but you won't like it if you're spoiled and used to perfect skatepark tranny.  - Mtak",0.0,,,City,6732,,(619) 527-3596,http://www.sandiego.gov/park-and-recreation/centers/memorialskate.shtml

It is now worth checking out. It's about 4X larger, it now features two rails (one larger than the other and both more easily approached from the left although not impossible on the right). It has a fun low ""concrete pic-nic table,"" stairs, ledges, little banks and the same pyramid with the expansion cracks at the bases. It is a very smooth park which flows well.  Now this wasn't planned out real well. It Features a pyramid in the middle of a square slab of slanted concrete. On the high end of the slope there is a wedge to start off of. If you get to much speed though you'll ollie over the whole pyramid and never be able to stop before the grass. There are also a couple of ledges that are well worn and too short.  Don't go too far out of your way to get to this one...at least not until they expand.  -J. Greenwood",0.0,,,City,4075,,,

Miller Park,,,Free,Outside,,No,Wood,,,,,Miller Park,43130,Lancaster,"(10/2006) Miller park is a nice intermediate park. They allow boards, bikes, skates and rollerblades. Always seems to be someone skateboarding there so locals try to watch out for their park. Besides having the manufactured ramps, which are wood frames covered in Skatelite, there is also a concrete curb along the long side of the park which has a modest blacktop uphill 4 foot rise incline running parallel to the full length of the park. This adds an added challenge for the more advanced skateboaders. The skate park sits next to the city pool and rec area and the county sheriffs office is within walking distance, so there is very little trouble. Really good outdoor wooden park. Good for essential street skating, featuring a pyramid with a ledge, 1 small fun box with rail, and one large fun box with rail, roll ins, a vert ramp, a mini-ramp, quarterpipes, a flat bar and a round bar. Also a rhythm section mostly for BMXers (ugh).

Monon Greenway,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,Yes,No,,,1235 Central Park Drive East,46032,Carmel,"4/12/2008 The skatepark sits in front of the West Complex, facing the Greenway. It features a small bowl that tapers from about 4ft. to around 6ft. deep, and a fairly large street area that is just filled to the brim with obstacles. Fast, smooth, and brand-new, there are lines to be found everywhere. The only bummer about the park is the 3/4in. wide seam that surrounds the flat bottom of the bowl. It makes for a slightly nasty kink when you hit it straight on. Otherwise, everything about this park is pretty damned good. The best time to skate it is early mornings, before the crowds arrive for the day. - Bud S. 6/25/07 Park features 4 rails, one big square rail, 2 large circle rails and one small square rail. The park also includes two euro gaps, two large hips, a steep 3 foot quarter pipe, and two banked ledges modeled after the famed MLK ledge in Miami Florida. There is also a 3ft to 6ft bowl with steel coping. Hard to get used to at first, but really a nice park.

Montauk City Park,,,Free,Outside,,Yes,Concrete,Yes,,,,S. Ely St. and Essex st.,11954,Montauk,"A full tank of gas from New York City, Montauk is a 3hour drive. It is best to fill the car with a few friends and call it a day trip, and bring beer and paper bags. The park is located in the beach town of Montauk at the tip of Long Island. The locals do nothing but surf, drink and eat, so they don't realize that their $1 million investment was a waste of money. John Woodstock strikes again. I have heard that he messed up the surface of the St. Augustine pool too. It is like riding on boat deck grip. The surface actually visibly wears your wheels down. The pool is a fun shaped righ handed kidney, with an 11 foot over vert deepend with butter coping and a 6 foot shallow end with kind of tight trannies. It is fun, but the impending doom looms over you after your first brush with the sandpaper surface. As a result, it is hard to open up in this pool. At any rate, we skated it the whole time we were there, because of the 1970's freeform area with flat banks (like KONA's freestyle area) and aluminum coping on the spine section, yuck. I would give this park a bad rating, but if you are from NYC, it is worth the drive once, just to conquer the burlyness of the poor construction. That gives the park more points in my book. It costs $11 if you are not a Montauk or Hamptons resident. I get the feeling that there aren't many. Watch video of our session on my website.  Tony - www.tonymisiano.com",0.0,0.0 ,,,3874,,,

It's in the east bay just on the other side of the Caldecott tunnel... I didn't see it on your site, so I thought you'd appreciate some photos...  It's a Wormhout design. The park is pretty small... a triangular shape, a 5ft bowl thats got a hip on one side and bowled on the other. If you're familiar with the Milpitas Vans elbowed mini... imagine that 5ft tall and bowled ends... The bowl is surrounded by a street area with a strange choice of transitions that start on one end and then all of a sudden there are some stairs.. weird... and apparently (according to a mother who was standing there) not a part of the original design. I'm kind of tired of people just ragging on skate parks so my opinion on this one was that it's pretty good.. I'm starting to get old... my knees hurt every time after I skate. I figure my time is limited, so i don't have time to be bummed on any skate park... I'll have fun skating anything at this point.  I had a ton of fun in this bowl.. the cement was very well poured with only minor warps which I had a hard time noticing.  - Colin",0.0,,,City,5409,,,

Also has a raised slider bar and some real grindable parking blocks. There is a ramp up to a box with a rail back down the other side. Lastly there is a built in lauch ramp ( 80's style).  Personally I liked slappying the curbs around the perimiter of the park the best. The ramp has bad seam problems but is ridable.

Mount Hawke,,Open,Pay,Indoor,Yes,Yes,Mixture,Yes,No,,,Mount Hawke,,Truro,"  Absolutely insane. Whilst getting lost in the Cornish wilderness, you approach the hidden gem that is Mount Hawke skatepark. A converted farm warehouse that received a lottery grant turned into probably the best skate-park in Britain. The park itself contains: Pro-size vert, 3 miniramps at varying heights, a rhythm section, 3 fun boxes, flat banks, 9ft quarter-pipes, and a death box. The rhythm section is where lines can be easily filmed, comprising of low manny pads, rails, and ledges. The street section may be a little large for skating (intended for BMX), but with enough speed it can be dealt with. The vert ramp is massive, but unfortunately it doesn't have any steps, so you have to run up it =[. There are 3 mini-ramps, 6ft, 4ft and 4 1/2ft, which are great for practice. If you have guts, you might want to try the death box, where you get serious air for big tricks. If you can, spend a whole day here, it's awesome (opens at about 10:30am). Thank you Cornwall, this is the best/only contribution to Britain. Pay varies between ages, and there is a membership to Cornish residents. There is a canteen on site, pool table, Xbox, TV and lockers. If you are there for the whole day, take plenty of water, and a helmet.  ",0.0,0.0 ,,,1385,,,

Mt.Trashmore,,,,Outside,,Helmets Only,Mixture,,No,True Ride,True Ride,Mt Trashmore Park Rd,23451,Virginia Beach,"062909: I'd gotten to check this place out finally. It's cool when it doesn't rain. That always puts a damper on the wooden parks or any parks for that matter. I was gonna skate this place 2 days prior, but yes, it rained. So I'd gotten here this morning and it opens at 8:00AM sharp. You have to sign in and get a wristband. You must have a helmet on before you enter the park and it has to be on the whole time in the park. Pads aren't required.  Upon entering, I'd noticed that the whole park is pretty much wooden. You have a concrete lot with wooden quarters and funboxes, a couple of rails, a picnic table and a wooden kidney-shaped bowl. I'm used to skating concrete parks and I wasn't quite sure about the wood. It seemed fine with my 101A wheels. I did some warming up on the quarter pipes before I hit the wooden bowl. This bowl was really fun. It's probably about 7' deep. Outside of this enclosed fenced-in park is the huge halfpipe. This halfpipe's got some major vert. It's huge. It reminds me of the halfpipe VB had back in the 80's.  So if yer comin' down to VB to vacation and/or to skate, make sure you have your helmet, 8:00AM sharp, and if the weather's gonna be about 103 heat index, hang it up, the park's gonna be closed as well as any other inclement weather.  Noki Skates (4/30/07) Just a quick update on the status of Trashmore's apparatus:   1. Spring of 2006 they built a 40 foot wide 13-1/2 foot metal framed vert ramp with nice counter sunk mounting screws on all the skatelite riding surface. The locals will inspire you to slip on the old knee pads and commence the weightless vert session. You just have to get the kids out of the flat bottom doing fakies...""take turns people"" 2. The bowl burnt down about 4 months ago and it's been completely rebuilt.  3. Mt Trashmore is free, you just have to wear your lid. If you stop by in the morning, it's uncrowded. 4. The bmx bikes are still plentiful but most of them don't hit the vert ramp.   Randall Fisher Awesome with a pool and street course. It's not wood, not concrete has a spine fun box and nice.  (2/8/2004) - This park is small with modular wood ramps on a concrete pad and one wood pool. After five months the ramps are pitted and cracked from weather and unrestricted bmx use. There has not been a single time I have skated this park without it being crowded. The layout is tight, unispired and there is no grom area or mellow old dude area. Despite this the locals are trying to make lemonade out of lemons as the park is getting 300 (according to the city) visitors a day! Do not go out of your way to hit this park unless you want to work on your bmx/skateboard doubles routine or slalom between the water seeping through the concrete pad. Might be worth it if you must skate a bowl NOW or you want to marval at the desire of the locals to skate anything.  VB has commited to a doubling of the size and maybe a concrete bowl by the end of 2004. This town is way behind the rest of the world when it comes to public parks and doing a bad job of catch up. Government has failed it's taxpayers and their kids, again. - comvortex",0.0,0.0 ,,City,9206,,,

Mulberry Fields,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,No,No,Grindline,,Ford Road and Whitestown Road,46077,Zionsville,"11/22/2009 Here's a composite-overview of Zionsville's skatepark. The park is all concrete, with a massive bowl complex, and a smallish street area. Located at the intersection of Ford Rd. and Mulberry Street, in front of the Zionsville Middle School, the skatepark was clearly well-designed, but poorly executed. The bowl has sloped, uneven rollout platforms... ripples all through the transitions, making it feel like skating in a washbowl... kinks and bumps everywhere. Had it been built competently, it would have been a sure-fire winner. But, it's barely worth the effort to get to from Indianapolis, a mere 20 miles or so away, and it sits vacant and deserted much of the time. 10/12/2008 This is a fairly well-designed, but not so well-built, all-concrete skatepark that has a small street section, and a fairly large bowl complex. The street section has quite a few flat banks of varying szes; A couple of very tall handrails; A couple of very abrupt wedge banks; A euro gap; And, three large hubba-style ledges.   The bowl ranges from about five to ten feet deep, and has a small ""pump bump"" in the flatbottom, as well as a large, over-vert clamshell. The bowl has a very noticable ""washboard"" effect, due to ripples and bumps in the concrete finishing. Apparently, it was designed by Grindline, but built by a local contractor with very limited experience in skatepark construction. Because of that, it's probably not worth more than a half-hour drive to check it out. -Bud Stratford  4/12/2008 There is a skatepark here under construction, due to open in the Fall of 2008. It will be located in Mulberry Fields, at the southwest corner of Ford Road and Whitestown Road. It looks to be a Grindline or Dreamland design, all concrete, with bowl and street elements. - Bud",0.0,,,City,10856,,,

I'll just go over the crete. The bowl would be refered to as a vertical snake run. Depths very from 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. In true Grindline style it has tons of rollovers and redirection pockets. I think there are 10 hips overall! The finish is perfect. In not so Grindline style there is not a pool coping block in site. The steel coping is layed in real good though. If you are in the Outer Banks you will want to hit this creation. It is a great example of maximum usage in a minimum space. The lines are endless...

The other 2 small dirt areas are gonna be grass for spectators in the park (also for tents on sleepover friday nites!!!).

Go there for the pool, vert all the way around, kidney, pool coping w/ death box, tile. This park is free and amazing. As a local said ""We tricked the city into letting us build this thing (the pool)"".  KILLER POOL  Fun park, lots a of pro demos go on here, and a lot of teh local pool rippers skate the pool, its a left handed kidney and is 10 feet deep with a foot of vert, the shallow is 6 feet with 6 inches of vert. Its a real pool, just for skating. the street course has a pyramid and a half bowl. At the far end of the half bowl there is a tombstone, very sick. Facing the half bowl is the ""green monster"" which is a quarter with bowled out ends that flow into the banks on either side. There is also an amoeba type thing. Concrete is fast, but sandpaper, don't slide when you fall, tumble... There are pics on the Hazer site. There are sick lines, and places for big airs.  This park is a Team Pain creation so you know what level of quality you are getting. It has a tranny style street course with two really good hips going into a horseshoe bowl. Also there is a pyramid with a rail/ledge, a killer speed bump thing, and a gnarly bowled quarter pipe with just a raw concrete edge for coping. But the most killer part of the park is the pool. I think it is 10 in the deep with a foot of vert and 6 in the shallow with tight but fully workable trannys. Pool coping and real tile all the way around too. This bowl has taken a beating for the last few years and evolved for a skatepark bowl into a truly gnarly backyard pool. If knocking a block loose or busting some tiles does not appeal to you, grab your purse and go home. Beer is cool and bikes go out over the fence. Enjoy.",0.0,,10000 square feet.,,7610,,,

Newington can be forgiven for this, since design-build hadn't really hit the region at the time this was erected. In any case, it is an example of how these concrete modular layouts look after a few years. Obviously, the heavy concrete slabs mounted on much softer asphalt eventually settle, and dangerous gaps begin to appear. Furthermore, the initial installation is left up to local contractors with no skate-knowledge and mistakes happen right out of the gate. The asphalt build-up around one pyramid is an all time classic ""certified piece"". Gaps along the miniramp transitions and the flatbottom are about 1/2"" wide and have been doctored with duct tape. Other seams where concrete meets asphalt are similarly dangerous. This testament to the modular concrete plague is located at the corner of Willard and New Britain Avenues in Newington, CT. Currently the Parks & Rec. Department in Newington is overhauling all of their facilities, and I have brought these obvious dangers to their director's attention. Until further notice, you may want to take a pass on this one and head to nearby Wethersfiled for some seamless concrete flow.   - Bill Helene",0.0,0.0 ,,City,6556,,,

It was built by Airspeed Skateparks, they have done a lot of the innovative crete stuff in Oregon, and all over. This park is hand trowled concrete. It has tranny from 1 ft. to 10 ft., the pools are fast and they have good lines. The park is all bowls, so street techs don't usually like it much. It does have a beefy 3"" rail that is about 25 feet long, and one flat bar. But besides that, it's made for airs and carves. Go to the Hazer east Coast Skate Zine site for pics, there are some in the parks and spots section, and a review of the park. The atmosphere is good, and it's a favorite spot to most of the local rippers, and top guys in the area. It is free, helmets required, open while school is in session after 2:30 until sunset or 8, and during the summer from 9 a.m. to sunset or 8. Check it out, you wont regret it.",0.0,,,City,7860,,,

And, one large fence surrounding the skatepark. It is kind of funny, because the covered gazebo just across the parking lot has no less than 30 real picnic tables stacked up in it. Maybe North Vernon should have just made that the skatepark. Realistically, the park probably is not worth the drive from across town. However, because it is conveniently located about halfway between Columbus and Madison, Indiana, you probably wont be able to avoid it.

Almost 100% concrete (except for two quarterpipes that sit just inside the fence), the park consists of a small, tight street area; A half-mini bowl with standard transitions and bank ramps; And, a most excellent clover bowl that ranges between 5ft. and 8ft. deep, with pump-bumps and steel coping. The bowls transitions- all of which approach vert- indicate that this might have been a Grindline creation. This is a pay-to-play park. There is an attendant at the gate, and helmets are mandatory. Hours are shown on the sign (pictured).  -Bud Stratford Perfect concrete job, fun multi-bowl 4ft. 5ft. 6ft. 7ft., and street stuff. Pay some $ to get in, must wear pads.

It is a challenging medium sized skatepark with a variety of terrain including: below ground pools with 8-10 foot walls, a nice roll-in section, two great outer rails, a rainbow round rail only about 2 feet off the ground and maybe 10-12 feet long, a 6 stair with a flat rail in the middle that has a launch up the stairs from the flat bottom, and multiple other features to keep everybody that visits occupied for a while. This is definitely a great skatepark for all the kids in the Kamas Valley who used to have to make the trip to Park City to skate. It is a little off the beaten path for all others to travel to, but if you are going to take the time to travel to the Park City Skate Plaza then I also recommend making some time to run over to this skatepark because it really isn't that much further and you will feel that it was worth it.",0.0,0.0 ,,,6891,,,

Oak Harbor Skatepark,,Open,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,,No,,,224 SE Jerome Street,98277,Oak Harbor,"Hey how's it going? I have some pictures of the finally completed skatepark out here. This took about 6 years from start to finish. I think the last bit of concrete was poured about two and a half years ago. I was a sophomore in high school when the first phase was built and was already graduated from college when it was finally completed. All the skaters in town, with the help of a volunteer architect, a concrete company and a few other people, helped raise money and do actual labor on the park. The city wasn't especially helpful at first, but we got the first few phases built, and eventually they finished off the rest of the concrete. Lights are in the original plan, but the city has not made any progress towards this. We are trying to get them going again on the project because once the last section of concrete was poured they haven't really done anything. This is a good street oriented skatepark with two pyramids, hips and bumps all over the place, and there's a square rail and round rail that are mellow and not too high or low, just right. They are very similar to good street rails. The different sections of the park connect to each other pretty well so you can flow all over the place. The newest section in the back of the park was has a bump to manual pad and some good ledges and hips. There is a curved ledge and a long hubba ledge with a short runway, but its doable. There is also a bowl and a 4 foot halfpipe which escalates into a 6 foot pipe. The tranny section of this park isn't too bad but its not the highlight of the park, if that's what you are looking for, head north 20 minutes to Anacortes and catch the ferry to Orcas Island. To get here from I-5, take the Burlington/Anacortes exit and head west for about 20 minutes, then head south on Highway 20, just before Anacortes. Cross Deception Pass Bridge and head about 10 minutes into Oak Harbor. Take a left on Whidbey Ave. (at Jack in the Box), then take a right onto Jerome St. There's swimming pool/senior center/baseball field parking lot on the right. Park there and walk behind the baseball field and you are there. There's a skateshop, Gizmo's Boardshop, about two blocks north on Midway Blvd. if you break a kingpin or something. Have fun.  - Terrill  Oak Harbor Skatepark is about 18,000 sq. feet and has everything. The park has been around for about 5 years. All concrete, it has two pyramids, a 6 ft and 4 ft halfpipe connected with and escalator, good ledges everywhere, Goldweld Grind rails helped out with the park, by donating and replacing some of the existing rails. This park is a good place to learn. Two five stair rails, one round, one square, real mellow and low. In back corner of park there as a Euro step-up to manual pad, and a really smooth hip next to it. Great flow around the park, lots of hips everywhere. No lights so come during the day. the park is located Two blocks south of Gizmo's Boardshop, off of Whidbey avenue of Jerome St. If you are coming in on highway 20, take a left on whidbey ave. then a right on Jarome st, and park in the Pool parking lot. It is located behind the pool in the field. Most people don't know about this park because it is on Whidbey Island, and it is a good 30 minute! drive from Mt.

Orlando Skate Park,,Open,Pay,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,Yes,Team Pain,,400 Festival Way,32801,Orlando,"(9/8/2006) Orlando Skate Park (Orlando FL) This is home for me! Memberships are a bit higher now (I believe I paid $125 last year). Hours are a bit different now too. They don't open till 11am now I believe and they are open till 10pm Monday through Thursday. Friday and Saturday they are open till 11pm. and Sunday till 7pm. 5pm -7pm on Sunday though is bike night so the flow course belongs to them unless you're good and they're cool with it. They don't complain when I ride it but I'm a regular they all know me and I actually ride fast as hell in that flow course. They're pretty cool to sit and watch inbetween runs in the pool because a lot of them are well sponsored and a few pros come out now and again. OSP has the friendliest locals at any park I have ever been to. PS- The photos with the fisheye lense completely ruin the look of that park. It needs no assistance in looking beautiful. I will send you some better ones if you like. The Orlando Skate Park consists of a beginner's area, a big flow course and a bowl. The beginner's course is perfect for kids that are just learning how to skate. It consists of a 4' tall half pipe, a 4' tall banked hip, a mini hubba ledge and a mini handrail. The flow course is huge measuring out to 8,000 Sq. Ft. The terrain ranges from 5' deep to 11' deep, changing in elevation several times on the deck and in the flat bottom. There is a spine with a transfer ledge across it, a 90-degree hip, a 45-degree hip, 3 rounded hips, six different pockets and a couple big extensions. It has a 4' tall roller blending into a 9' transition that's perpendicular to it. There is an 11' vert wall with 3' of vert and plenty of transfers, gaps and speed lines. The bowl has a 6' deep shallow end with a round pocket and a square pocket and a round 9' deep end. It is equipped with painted pool coping and tile.  Park Rules: A signed or notarized waiver must be on file. Helmet, elbow and knee pads are required  Prices: 3 Hour Session for non-members is $6. Memberships begin at $15 per year and range up to a $100 membership that includes unlimited session for a year and discounts in our fully equipped pro shop. Sessions run 9 AM to Noon - Noon to 3 PM - 3 PM to 6 PM and 6PM to 9 PM. Birthday parties and facility rentals for private functions are available.",0.0,,,City,15299,,407.246.2800,http://www.cityoforlando.net/admin/cfo/realestate/skatepark/index.htm

People from cities across Minnesota anxiously awaited the opening of one of the largest skate parks in the metro area. The Overpass spans across 18,000 square feet and is home to 14 pieces of aggressive skating spine ramp, pyramids, rails and jumps. The Hopkins Area Jaycees donated $135,000 toward the park. Portions of the contributions were used to purchase the park equipment. The Overpass offers aggressive skating enthusiasts piano banks, fun boxes, kinked rails and staircases, and protective helmets and pads. Another feature truly unique to the Overpass, is its location. The Overpass is located under the Highway 169 overpass in Hopkins. The highway overpass protects skateboarders and rollerbladers from the rain, but not from the elements of winter.

Oxford Skate Park,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,Yes,No,Grindline,Grindline,312 Bramlett Blvd.,38655,Oxford,"they are finishing development of a city public skatepark. I saw from a distance that they were pouring concrete, but I figured it would be a run of the mill mediocre park with mostly street skating in mind, with maybe a couple of 4 foot walls with transition on them here or there, or even maybe a little 4 to 5 foot bowl at most. Well, I wasn't prepared for what I saw. They have almost finished construction on a HUGE pool with vert. This pool is better than anything in probably 90% of the public parks in so cal. The shallow end (no roll in indcluded, strictly drop in) is no more shallow than 6 feet, which empties into a huge bowl area that is about 8 to 9 feet deep with one section containing a wall around it that extends the height to about 11 feet with a good 2 feet of vert. Then it empties to the left, like and L shape, into a double clover-like section one side curls around in a nice wide big bowl, the other side is a super tight, verted, backyard pool-like section. In these areas the depth does not look to be under 8 or 9 feet. It's massive, and I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what they are doing building this thing in Oxford, Mississippi. The skater population here is extremely small. But rumor has it that the mayor's son is a skater and had something to do with the decision in building a park of this scale. So, people like me are stoked on that! This is a world-class pool they are building. Once this thing is finished I'm pretty sure people will come from all over to skate it. I'll send some pics as soon as they are done pouring the thing. There is one little section that hasn't been poured yet. I think the ETA on the opening of the park is around early March or so. Just a heads up. It will definitely be worth going out of your way to no where Mississippi to check this park out.

Loads of quarter pipes, and a pyramid, some ledges, and rails make it a little better for the street skaters, but nothing worth checking out if your a bowl rider.  - J.ed  We're told the park is getting some new ramps soon. (It's 6/22/2000 as this is written) There's a mellow pyramid, a small ledge box, a long slider bar, and a big horseshoe ramp. The ramp is about 7 feet tall and almost vert and has coping that sticks out pretty far. This adds to the gnarly factor.

Park City Skate Park,,,Free,Outside,Yes,,Concrete,,,Site Design,Site Design,Sullivan Road,84060,Park City,"Park City is by far the best park in Utah. The guys that told me that Logan was better than Park City had not actually been to both parks. Logan is a nice park, but Park City is great. It's comparable to Fontana CA. or Coronado CA. The bowl complex they have is totally unique--unlike anything I've seen anywhere else. The big wall in the deep end has pool coping, too. It doesn't look any bigger than the round at Fontana, but some of the local kids swore that it is 10' deep. At any rate it is plenty tall.  The street course looked decent, but I didn't skate it at all. (There is also a big square half bowl at the end of the street course.) There are endless lines to be found in the big bowl complex. There is the biggest bowl at one end and a nice little rectangle pocket at the other. In between those there are two or three half bowls (two of them separated by a spine) that all face a nice sized quarter pipe wall. There is metal coping all around, except on the big wall where it is pool coping (that still looks relatively untouched even after a few years).  There are so many corners and hips that face each other in this thing, it is unbelievable. All the trannies are smooth and fast. You can drop in almost anywhere and get plenty of speed to go anywhere else in the bowl complex. (I don't know what else to call it, it's like a whole series of square bowls all connected and flowing into each other.)  This park is extremely shreddable. If you are anywhere near it and want to hit a good park, do not miss this one. It's even road-trip worthy because it is so unique. I heard some stories about the Birdhouse team passing through recently. I'm sure they blew the place up. Anyone that likes to go fast and hit big will have tons of fun at this place.  (These pictures don't do it justice. Sorry they are a bit glared out.)   - Nathan Westbrook",0.0,0.0 ,,City,7676,,615.5631,

There are other ramps but mostly for bikes (rough concrete ground). The ramps are in roughed up condition but the big halfpipe was a lot of fun to ride. The smaller halfpipe is in for some serious repair (again bikes roughed it up with holes and busted edges). They charge freakin $12 to ride and for a skater..that is limited.

Pier 62,no,,free,outside,no,no,concrete,yes,no,,,"62 Chelsea Piers, New York, NY 10011",92612,New York City (Manhattan),"An East Coast version of California's Venice skatepark, Pier 62 sits on the edge of the Hudson River in the Chelsea District of Manhattan. Designed and built by California Skateparks/Site Design, this is a thoroughly modern park with smooth, fast concrete and an eye towards high-speed flow. Pier 62 is a new park, and it rides like it, featuring ample flat ground, several rails, numerous hubbas and ledges, as well as a flow bowl with escalators, steel coping, noping, rounded hips, banks, transition walls and a cradle, and a stellar pool. The concrete is perfect--super smooth, but not slippery, and incredibly fast. The park is open daily 8am-dusk. There is no on-site attendant, and despite the signage advising pads, there was no enforcement. It is fenced, and there was evidence that grafitti is aggressively removed. The park was very clean, and skaters ran the full gamut from young groms with their parents, teen-agers, and adults of all ages including several crusty older vert-dogs and the now common instructor giving lessons. I was surprised to see a lot of the pool skaters wearing pads, and not just the older dudes. Roller blades are permitted, and there were several cruising around. The park flow is very well designed, from the upper flat-ground with hubbas and rails leading to a series of banks, and gradually merging into a deeper bowled run that terminates into a cradle. Wall sizes range from knee-high to 10ft+, with lots of escalators and banked decks--plenty of fly-outs on order. The pool is very, very good, although a little light on vert in the deep end. It features a 7ft shallow end with squared corners, and rides like a mini-ramp, stopping well short of vert--an excellent learning zone. A rounded 8-ft. mid-section just hits vert, and the 11-ft (maybe 11.5) deep section is large enough for serious air. It has tile and new-school pool coping. Bring your park-formula wheels and get your shred on!      ",0.0,0.0 ,15000 square feet.,City,3790,,,http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/explore-the-park/activities/pier-62-skatepark

You would think that a rich, yuppie town like Piedmont would kick down $$$ for a decent skatepark. Wrong. Whoever designed it must have been on crack. The one good part is the ""tuning fork"" bowl which is fun. It's a tiny park with only a few workable elements. It has a weird snake run that goes uphill (!?) A pyramid that is about 8 inches high, a couple grind rails and the bowl. All fenced in with a monitor to make sure you wear your pads. The one I met was a cool girl named Tallene. Easy job but kind of pointless. This place is rule central. It's way up on the side of a hill which is always nice (not). To get to it you have to park, walk across a big baseball field, then up a flight of stairs. No water fountain or bathrooms close by. Nice. It was hot as hell when I was there. Not even close to any food or drink. The cement work is nice and smooth but not worth the effort to go there. You'd be better off sessioning a local curb or ditch. I'll give this place a 3 out of 10. It's retarded. Definitely a beginner park if it's for anyone at all. -Eric Fortner",0.0,0.0 ,,,4282,,,

On the other side of the 6 ft. is a wave bank ramp with a 6 ft. quarter pipe on each side. Across from that is a 5 ft. quarter pipe with two 6 ft. extensions. Between the bank ramp and the 5 ft. quarter pipes is a blue 6 ft. grindrail about 8 or 9 inches high. Beside the 5 ft. quarter pipe is another 6 ft. wave bank ramp. Beside that is a 6 ft. quarter pipe. Then a 6 ft. roll in. Next is a 5 ft. bank ramp with a grindrail ledge thingy like 1 foot above that. Across from the six foot roll in is a pyramid with a rail down the middle and on the side. In front of that is like a 10 or 12 foot vert wall and a really steep bank ramp. Beside that is a 4 ft. roll in that if you go down that it leads to the bank ramp for plenty of tricks. Along the wall by the 4 ft. roll in and the bank ramp is a ledge running all the way across which is like 2 1/2 feet high. (You can do tricks off of it. I like to f/s 180 off of it.)  It has a deck to chill and look at the park which is 8 ft. high. There are plenty of soda machines, a snack machine and a big screen t.v. to watch videos on. You have to have a waiver filled out by your parents if you are under 18. You have to wear a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads. They do have all of them for rent.

There is a ""pool"" in the back but it just doesn't seem to be built correctly.  Getting to the coping is almost impossible. Then there is the bowl section. For some reason the bottom is not level.  All the locals start at the same spot, ride down to the oververt wall and then come back.  There are not very many lines in it.  The spine is impossible to air.  Most of the coping is impossible to get at.   The bathrooms are clean and there are pay showers by the tennis courts. Entrance fees are 500 yen  The staff is mostly older adults that have never seen skateboarding before.  They are totally unreasonable and enforce the rules like the SS.  The park is very far from any train station.  There is a bus from Hachioji station that runs once an hour, it takes 40 minutes from station to park.   Bottom line, not worth the time it takes to get to this park.  Although it is big there are better parks that are easier to get to in the Tokyo area.",0.0,,45000 square feet.,City,8743,,,http://tobuki-sp.jp/

Poway Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,No,Wormhoudt,CA. Skateparks,13090 Civic Center Drive,92064,Poway,"There is a new park in Poway, San Diego. It has lights til 9:30 is free and requires pads. 8ft bowl with snake run into it with a 10-11 ft vert wall. Street course has a pyramid with a ledge and some quarter pipes. Its right behind the cop station.  (2/18/04) - Poway is a fun little park, but it's not worth a special trip. The park has a small reservoir section with a pyramid and fun box thing, and a flat bank and small quarter pipe sections around the perimeter. The reservoir section flows into a small snake run that varies in depth from about 4 feet to about 6 feet. The end of the snake run has a vert wall that's maybe 8 feet tall. The snake run is fun, but it's poorly designed (in my opinion) as a series of bowls rather than a true S-shaped snake run. Skate it and you'll see what I mean. The outer deck of the park includes some rails and a bunch of ledges.  Pros - packs a decent punch for such a small park; fun little snake run; tons of parking; clean restrooms; unsupervised; great concrete work; vending machines; lights.  Cons - almost unskateable when it gets crowded; pad requirement is strictly enforced (they issue tickets without warning); police station is next door; no vert.  - Mark T.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,3001,,858.668.4674,http://www.powayskate.com/

Rålis Skatepark,no,,Free,Oustide - Under a bridge,Yes,No,Concrete,Yes,No,Placed To Ride,Placed To Ride,Rålambshovsparken,,Stockholm,"Rålis (ra:wlis) Skatepark is a new (Nov. 2010) concrete park in a cool central city site. It is built under a bridge to keep it from being too wet. Local board sport association Stockholm Suburban Surfers first popped the idea in 1985, but it was not until late 2007 that the City of Stockholm finally decided to build the park. Three years later the dream came true. The park is pretty allround, but major part is bowl or pool orientated. This is basically what you´ll find in Rålis Skatepark: * Gnarly backyard pool. Deep end pretty wide, shallow end tight. Concrete coping. * Big open bowl with oververt corner and deeper bowl at other end. Gap with roll-in in deep end. Steel coping. * Two-cornered bowl with wide roll-in from open end. * Small shallow oval bowl, slightly higher wall in one end. Steel coping. * Several quarter pipes in different sizes. * A rainbow taco with steel coping. * Several curbs in different sizes. * Several rails in different sizes. * A four (?) step staircase. * Yeah, and some other stuff. The skatepark is located in Rålambshovsparken, a big park where Stockholmers spend their weekends and evenings in summer. There is a restaurant, a bar, an ice cream booth and often hot dog stands in the park. It´s close to the water of Lake Mälaren, in which you can cool yourself off with a swim after skating. (Not necessarily drinking the water). Just beside the concrete you´ll find street basket courts, beach volleyball courts, shot put area, long jump pit and running courts.",0.0,,4500 square feet.,City,4239,,,http://www.subsurfers.se/category/skate/skateparks/ralis-skatepark-skateparks-skate/

The park is 60% concrete and 40% wood. It is run by the City of San Diego Park and Rec Dept and will abide by their rules. At this time the park will cost $30 dollars every three months for a membership which will allow you access to the three Park and Rec skateparks: RPQ, Robb Field in Ocean Beach and Memorial southeast of downtown SD. Pads are required at this time. The last word I got was an opening sometime in April maybe.  -Aric ""The Colonel"" Sanders Project Description: The Rancho Pe?asquitos Skate Park will be located between Carmel Mountain Drive and Highway 56 (Ted Williams Parkway) east of the Caltrans Park & Ride. The park is designed as a street course with a mixture of concrete and wood structures and a landscaped buffer around the entire perimeter consisting of trees, shrubs, and ground cover to help blend the project with the surrounding neighborhood. For security, a fence encloses the entire skate area. The fence adjacent to Carmel Mountain Drive will be constructed of Ornamental Iron to help blend with the surrounding community. The project also includes a staging area that consists of a check-in/storage/restroom building, seating areas with trees in tree grates for spectators and skaters, drinking fountains, and vending machines. Twenty-one parking spaces within the Caltrans Park & Ride will be utilized to maximize the recreation space. Disabled parking (two-spaces) is provided in the skater/pedestrian drop-off area at the east portion of the park site. The design of the park simulates a street course. Some of the design elements are banks, transitions, grind walls and ledges, rails, benches, a picnic table installed over a set of stairs, and a 10-stair element with ledges and a rail. The concrete portion of the project will primarily be along Carmel Mountain Drive, taking advantage of slopes from the existing sidewalk into the project site. The wood structures are situated along the southern boundary of the project. By using wood structures within this skate park it will allow for these pieces of equipment to eventually be changed or moved around. The landscaping includes two palm trees in planters within the skate area to not only create some shade but to also simulate a common street element for the skaters to use in developing their skills. The park is designed for all ability levels from beginners to the more advanced skaters.",4.0,0.0 ,23000 square feet.,City,5365,,(858) 525-5337,http://www.sandiego.gov/park-and-recreation/centers/ranchopenskate.shtml

Redmond Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,Yes,Concrete,No,No,,,8420 161st Avenue NE,98052,Redmond,"Well it's finished finally, but not yet open, there is still tons of sand everywhere, so you could skate it but I don't recomend it if you value your bearings. Although it's still not a very good park, it is about 100% better than it was. The new bowl and ditch look like the most fun. Half of it has Noping and the other side has enough of a ledge that you can grind, but i have a feeling that after a while it will get chewed to shit, so it seems like a mistake to not at least have the noping go all around it, but oh well. It's about 5-6 feet and goes down to about 3 feet it has pretty decent trannies. the other bowl (next to the old one and the slug) looks ok, but it has huge mellow trannies and it's kind of uphill, it's about 5 feet. then they fixed the pyramid so it's actually useable, added a handrail next to the old stairs that were already there, and a couple ledges around the park. The other big new addition is a kiddie section, which looks worthless for anybody e! xcept little kids, but that is a good thing so they will stay out of the way. Anyway I've included some photos (relax i kept them as small as i could, I'll send Bob the larger ones to put on sleestak) so you can judge it for yourselves. Overall I think it looks pretty fun if you live nearby or you're stuck in Redmond, but not really worth the drive if you're from outside the Eastside, well maybe at least once.  -Solo66burn (3/30/2002)  Update 2001 - The snake run bowl thing is being made and should improve this park considerably. Still it'll only be good enough for beginers to intermediate riding.  It's free, concrete, and outdoor. Initially, this park made me extremely pissed off! I mean how can anyone say they put the sport of skateboarding into the premier focus of the civic leaders and come out with this? The terrain is boring and offers no challenges except to stay alive. The pyramid is super tight, the walls have little to no transition to speak of, the coping sticks out on the small end of the bowl, the lump arm thingy sucks since you can't get a good angle on it, ...etc.. But hey we got beautiful interlaced brick walkway's and nicely landscaped mounds to sit on and watch the little monkey's on their toy's from. What was supposed to come first here? Skateboarding or picknicking? Obviously picknicking won out. Someday, someone will let skaters build a park and it will be SICK!!! Oh wait , they already did that at Burnside! And they got a real skatepark! Well anyhow, its still worth riding a couple times. The only thing that got me cooled off of my fury was some wise words from a bigtime skateboarder about this might actually help skateboarding by not going overboard too fast too soon! Then having everyone give up because they can't ride the big terrain, then loosing the land because it would be more valuable as something else.",2.7,0.0 ,,City,4411,,,

The good thing is that all of the coping is nice, and the ""river"" obstacle thing will be great for landspeed stunts.   The bad thing is that the miniramp has large jagged rocks sticking into the side of it, so don't even think of slamming.

It has a variety of terrain including bowls, ramps, rails, banks, slopes, hips, spines, and a street course, etc. Much of it has metal coping on the edges. It is decently built and designed and can keep you entertained for a while, but the main drawback is its limited-use hours. Apparently, when they built it they made an agreement with the elementary school that the skatepark would never be open while the school was in session. This means that on school days the skatepark is locked until 3:30pm. (They even threaten to prosecute you for trespassing if you try to use it when it is closed.) All other days of the year the skatepark is open from 7:00am to 9:00pm. Also, the skatepark is only open to BMX riders on Mondays and Thursdays from 6:00pm to 9:00pm and on Sundays from 7:00am to 11:00am year round. If all that isn't enough to keep track of then here is more. During the summer the skatepark is only open to elementary age children on Wednesdays from 7:00am to 12:00pm, and while school is in session it is only open to elementary age children on Fridays from 1:30pm to 3:30pm.",0.0,,,,10062,,,

Riverside Railroad Skatepark,yes,Open,Free,Outside,Yes,Helmets Only,Concrete,,No,Alltech,Grindline,1700 River Dr. North,59401,Great Falls,"10/17/2008 Hey there I'm just gonna give u a little update on the Skate Park in Great Falls, MT. Its been a few years since its been opened so its Probably time to update the information a little. Well first of all the park does have lights now.. Well it always had lights but they never turned them on till graffiti became an issue, haha. Huge park, Simply Amazing. Your skill level will never be an issue to what u can do at this park, there is something for everyone. The park is really fun still after years of riding it. its funny because at times u see the mini section just getting all the use. There is always room in the park, if one feature or bowl is crowded there is plenty of skatepark being untouched that u ride. Fun for everyone. occasionally a pro demo will come through town and skate it from time to time. Everyone is welcome, and outsiders will not feel weird or out of place/ kicked out. The lights are...okay. there's about 7 or so lights around the skatepark i want to say but there's a lot of concrete to light.. it does an okay job of it... they keep it just lit enough so you can ride it at night, but does leave some shadows in places, which make it hard to be smooth. the lights try and test to see how good your night eyes are... best to ride it with a full moon.. easier to see. Just a Little update on the rules now.. they do enforce helmets from time to time. usually no problem but bring one just in case the officers of law come.. that's about it.. its a great park feel free to come visit! - Vinny G. ...on your web site you asked for more information about the Great Falls, Montana Skate Park. Well for starters it is 27,000 sq feet. Not to bad for a state that has more deer then people. The park opened a week ago, and is getting a fair amount of use. Nothing compared to what it will receive once word gets out. This park is big. The park sports three bowls both vertical and over vertical. The park is packed with dips, curves, spines, fun boxes, rails, curbs, gaps, and over a 100 transitions. The park can accommodate every skill level from beginner to extreme pro in the the bowls and full pipe. The City is charging no admission and the Grindline designed park open just last weekend. This is definitely in the top 20 parks nation wide, if not the top 10. All our park needs is promotion, contests, and maybe sponsership. I know that it seems big, especially for a small town park, but already on weekends it gets a lot of visitors. I would love to see it expand even larger in the future. All we need to do is show how much use it will get. More park info can be found at http://www.ci.great-falls.mt.us/people_offices/park_rec/skatepark.htm The great falls tribune just had a section in the Sunday, Mar. 21st paper including a site map and photos.

IN ADDITION ALL CITY ORDINANCES AND PARK RULES WILL BE ENFORCED. THANK YOU City of Great Falls Park & Recreation Department . This was a very fun park, it deserves some pictures. I am looking forward to riding it again on the way to Hailey. Only a couple things to add to the current description. The pipe is only 6' long at most It doesn't look like it was made to be ridden, it's more of a pedestrian bridge. And the old fashioned reservoir is a cool addition. -Doug",0.0,,,City,7441,,771-1265,http://www.ci.great-falls.mt.us/people_offices/park_rec/skatepark.htm

I am not sure how long it has been changed now, but last time I was home (that is, back at Rock Rapids) all the old crappy, rotten ramps were gone. Now there is a mini ramp halfpipe on the north side. There is a banked wedge on the east edge of the square leading into a 3 sided pyramid leading into a 4 or 5 foot quarter pipe. In the southern half of the square is a 6 inch high flat rail, and 1 ft. and 2 ft. high narrow rails. I can not remember who the ramps are made by, but they have got that weatherproof black surface material stuff covering aluminum bars. It is a million times better than it used to be.

Roy City Jam Park,,,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,,No,,,2900 W 4600 S,84067,Roy,"It is a pretty decent skate park. I like the lay out. It's a medium size park with a two bowls, one with 9 foot walls and a 10 foot extension. The other has 3 foot walls and moves up to 8 foot walls and a hip. There's a spine connecting the two bowls the side on the big bowl is a foot deeper. Also one of the main attractions is a 15 foot tall volcano it goes in almost all directions in the street part. It's very smooth. It's medium size but with a large park attitude.  When I first drove up to this park with a bunch of my pals to try it out, I thought that it looked like no fun. but after scraped knees and a few fun miniramp sessions I changed my mind. it is a small park with a 4or 5 foot bowl and and a 2-3 foot side on it(which is fun to launch out of or work on your lip tricks) it also has a small pyramid with a mini handrail on one side. It has a large volcano making speed no problem. It's not much of a park for rails or boxes but it is still fun. Some people might tell you that the park stinks but we are skateboarders and anything is good for us. You might say that this review can not be very good about a park because I am only fourteen, but remember I am a skateboarder, and that makes all the difference.

The park has two very large bank/quarterpipe combos, with a centerpiece half-pyramid/handrail/euro gap between them. Off to the side, there's a kinked rail slide bar and a short manual box. Then, way off on the opposite end of the park, there's a few smaller assorted obstacles, including a couple of small fly boxes, launch/jump ramps, and a big ""pump bump"".    Overall, it's not a bad park, but it's definitely not among the best that I skated this year either. -Bud Stratford",0.0,0.0 ,,City,4773,,,

NO one checks to see if anyone is dropping in from down there at the other end of the bowl. There is a ton of street stuff.

Just a little correction/update on the Saratoga Springs park in NY. Most important is the pool is a Sloppy Sam/Breaking Ground project. The pool replaced one of the oldest park vert ramps in the northeast. Somehow it got mislabeled as wormhoudt. It is a legit back yard pool (not bowl) tucked into a shitty municipal skate park. The trannies are tight, the vert for real, and all block coping. People in the know travel to sk8 this one. Next the rest of the Park is no longer crappy wood ramps with rusty metal (R.I.P.) no we have gone one step worse it now ice rink slick pre-fab painted metal ramps with no tranny. There is no reason to go to the park except the pool but the pool is worth the drive especially if your warmed up at Bondville, VT and want to get a tighter and steeper. street course made of wood and skate lite, couple tables and rails, a 4 or 5 foot mini, whole street course is slow and boring, but tucked away in the corner of this aweful wooden park is a beautiful cement backyard pool style bowl with a super tight 4foot shallow and a 8 or 9 foot deep end with a good foot of vert, cement coping all the way around, this bowl is the only reason worth coming to this park",0.0,,,City,9711,,,

We lived up there probably 7 years ago and it was there then. The concrete is still in Good Shape, not too rough. It looks like they are doing a lot of work to the place. The fence is new, I'm not sure if they are changing their rules and hours utilizing the fence. It's a fun little park. The beginner roll in bowl was a hoot for my 8 year old. No restrooms, No lights. I would rate it a 7 or 8. The bigger bowls were fun, the Street part had some extreme angles to go down or up, but still a lot of fun. - Daniel",0.0,0.0 ,,,8224,,,

I give it a 7 After receiving a 50/50 match grant from the Florida Recreation Development Assistance Program, the city hired a design firm to work with teenage residents to develop a skateboarding facility for both beginner and advanced skaters. They completed the park, with help from the Parks and Recreation Department, in two months; it opened in May 2001. Part-time employees take tickets and have skaters sign liability wavers. The city wanted to offer its youth a venue for supervised activity, while trying to eliminate the damage done to curbs and sidewalks by skateboards. The park has been very successful. (Oct. 2005) The park is putting in new wood as of October 2005. If you wear pants you don't have to wear knee pads. The small section in the backround has 2 qp's a 2 foot spine a little  fun box with a rail and a roll in the big section has a 6 ft. roll in a 3 sided fun box with a hubba ledge  going down it there's lots of slants and there is a 2 leveled funbox the bottom level has a ledge with angle iron the upper level has a rail like knee high and a hubba ledge down both sides the half pipe deck is attached to a bunch of slants going down the the fun boxes.

DreamLand is scheduled to break ground on August 13th with a projected completion date of October 15th.  We will post pictures at the City website www.ci.bay-city.or.us Shaena Peterson The proposed Ken Downie SkatePark in Bay City will be a gathering place everyone will take pride in, a place that celebrates our youth. Skateboarders are our kids and friends and we want them to have somewhere to go where they are safe and welcome. Skateboarding is an exciting and fascinating sport; no wonder it is the fastest-growing athletic activity among todays youth. A challenging skatepark will provide a facility for our kids to be incredible athletes. We wont isolate this skatepark in some remote corner. As a community, Bay City doesnt shy away from kids or exile them to back-corners of parking lots or remote fields. And the City Council agrees; the upper park in Bay City already has a great covered area, picnic tables, and an excellent sidewalk leading right up to the site of the skatepark. The Bay City Council has repeatedly said they believe in a skatepark, but they could not allocate money from the budgets street fund. We are lucky that an inventive bunch of young people has begun the process to make Kens Place a reality. We have received conceptual drawings from DreamLand",0.0,0.0 ,,City,4165,,503.812.6773,http://www.ci.bay-city.or.us

It is located on rte. 30, at the Mountain School - east side of road just north of town center. Too bad I didn't get to skate it but from what I hear its a gem. The rumor at the Jiffy Mart down the road is that (1) the cops found a few too many beer cans at the site and (2) a few broken bones already. So the town may have ""policies"" in place by spring. We'll see. Nevertheless, its helping the scene in Vermont big time.  Bill Helene",0.0,0.0 ,,City,7582,,,

Christiansburg Skatepark,yes,Open,,,,,,,,,,North Franklin,,Christiansburg,"Reader Review (3/17/2011) The Christiansburg park video isn't very good, but it'll give you an idea. The B-Burg park has a pool that is maybe 7ft in the shallow end and 10 ft in the deep end. It's not the best pool to flow in, but if you skate it like a half pipe it is still fun. And then there is a stair set with a hand rail and some hubbas and a bank and a nice box. Not a great park for long lines, but still worth a visit if you are in the area. The C-burg park is much more street oriented with a huge concrete section with ledges and stairs. And then the older section is all metal ramps and fun boxes and banks. There is a nice little 4 foot mini ramp too. ",0.0,,,City,6414,,,http://www.christiansburg.org/index.aspx?NID=406

The latest victim of this trend is Clinton, CT. The budget for this park was reportedly in the $200K range. Somehow the Breaking Ground design/build bid was rejected, presumably because it included a charge for design. With the Scituate Concrete ""system"" the kiddie committee of Clinton got to design this themselves. Too bad they ""designed"" it using inferior elements made by prefab concrete charlatans. So with Clinton you get a cramped, fenced-in hodgepodge of no-flow elements on an asphalt pad. The mixture of concrete and asphalt adds flesh removal to an already high crash up derby factor.

This is a VERY small town in north eastern Washington. They have 3 determined kids and a few parents that give a damn, and the next thing you know, Dreamland is building a park there. Approximately 10,000 sq.ft., it consists of a large main bowl with a spine. The deep end is about 9 feet deep and square shaped with a spine into the shallow side, which is mostly squared with a whipping corner-capsule. The rest of the park has got some really fun stuff, like a rainbow rail, mini-mini ramp section with 2 separate spines. There is a whoop-d-doo section that leads to a mini jersery barrier wall, small banks and hips, a big 3, a ledge and rail down a bank. A fine job done by the boys of Dreamland. We all had a blast skating that park, its super fun, and the kids are cool. -Matt Splat",0.0,0.0 ,,,2907,,,

It is definitely road-trip worthy. Located on W. River Dr., this FREE park is a good-sized beast with super smooth transitions (some shallow bowls, a small spine, a couple tight corners a bank or two, and some deep bowls...among others). As well as the bowls there is a good number of street obstacles (a good 8-stair, a bunch of rails, a double-set, some hubbas, a box/manny-pad, a Euro-gap, etc.). There are no lights...yet.  Davenports park is riddled with awesome paintings done by the locals. Nearby (on 1601 W Locust St) is a GoodTimes skate/bike shop. There are also some good street spots around the area (since it is part of the Quad Cities). -Sticky Sweet new park here - Concrete, No pads, FREE, Lights 24/7 coming in March 07 check out the pic.

Maish Rd.,46041,Frankfort,"4/16/2008 The Frankfort, IN skatepark consists of prefabricated, concrete obstacles by Concrete Skate Concepts. Unlike most CSC skateparks, Frankforts obstacles are not merely placed onto a concrete slab.  Instead, they were placed onto the grounds; then, the concrete was poured between the obstacles to create the flats. This makes the whole park feel smooth, seamless, and almost totally free of kinks. It might well be one of the best prefab-concrete parks in the state. The skatepark features a half-pyramid, with a ledge; Two full-width mini ramps, with extensions, and a very large platform between them; A 6-stair handrail with two hubbas on either side; A very steep hip with boost ramps set into the walls; And, several smaller boxes, rails, ledges, and quarterpipes. -Bud Stratford",0.0,0.0 ,,City,6448,,,

Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Skatelite,No,No,,,Park Drive and Gooseberry Lane,46103,Greenwood,"4/12/2008 This is a Woodward-designed, prefabricated skatelite/metal ramp park. It consists of obstacles in the 3-5ft. height range, including flat banks, quarterpipes, fly boxes, and two very long rails, as well as a few shorter railslide bars. All of this is set on a large group of unused tennis courts. The park is probably about 4-5 years old, and is showing its age: The ramps are beginning to settle into the asphalt, and the black paint is well-worn, allowing rust patches to form on many of the ramps. There is a lot of pushing room here, as the tennis courts must be at least 8000 sq. feet, maybe more. -Bud S.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,5560,,,

Located in Community Park on N. Franklin Road between 56th St. and Pendleton Pike, it's a prefab concrete skatepark, built on a concrete slab. It's small, it's tight, and there's a zillion kids there, all confined inside a ridiculously high chain-link fence that makes the place feel more like a gated prison than a skateboard park. Apparently, it's open late: It has lights installed, presumably for after-dusk skating.",0.0,,,,8208,,,

The open area in the middle has a spine ramp integrated with a steep pyramid. there is also a manual box, fairly long and movable rails you are free to change around and set up however you like.

Just start shredding and they'll get out of your way and eventually leave. And, more recently, the remaining 1/3 of the times I've been to maple shade the cops show up and threaten to give $400 fines for not wearing a helmet (Is the fine still $300 for skating love park?). Say you didn't know and they'll just keep giving you warnings.   Maple Shade is a typical Wally Holiday park; simple design, smooth finish, and a street section that kinda leaves you scratching your head. He did a good job with the big bowl and the fact that they didn't give him much space to work with (8000 square feet). A little pool block would have been nice. They just raised the toll back to Philly to $4 and I've heard by the end of the year it'll be $5. I wont be making the trip much after Roslyn, PA gets finished. I'd give it a 6 on the days that it's open and you don't have to talk to cops, more like a 4 the rest of the time.   Spare Change-",0.0,,,City,9833,,856-482-6012,http://www.mapleshadeskatepark.com/

On the narrow end of the ""L"", there's a 12"" tall by 6' long steel box, and a small quarterpipe that's about 4' tall and 8' wide. The whole park is covered by camera monitoring, and is surrounded by 12' high chain link fence (with razor wire at the top). The park also has picnic areas, ample parking, and a water fountain.

Oh, and it has lights. Coping is set better than Burien or Renton. The Negative: The design leaves one searching for speed. So, one has to work pretty hard to get speed. The triangle shape of the shallow leaves no ""mini-ramp"" area for the groms, which some liked, but not the kids. There's a small corner pocket on one end of the shallow area. This creates a dead end. The bowl isn't nearly deep enough, and with an escalator on one end of the deep end, there's no opposing wall to the 8 foot tall wall on the otherside. No pool coping. Nothing to get excited about. But a good place to session at night while we wait for Milton to get done, a real skatepark with lights.  Here's what Carl (auggie) said about the street area: I don't know why I thought it would be good. I was trying to keep a positive attitude, but that shit seriously sucks ass. It either has no run up, or no roll out. Purkiss-Ross trademark round coping ledges. No pyramid. That stair gap to rail thing is good for gnar points, but the math is all wrong through that place. The table is ridiculously high for that mellow bump.. downhill runways.. ledges and stairs with no runways or roll outs.. they are for phantom skaters from the future who fly in on their hoverboards to lay down a backside smith, then fly away to the next dimension.  It was hard to get inspired.  - Dan",0.0,,,City,3755,,,

It is the 5th shotcrete skatepark in the last 4 years after two decades of countless useless little prefab ""skateparks"" so we are very happy over here about the turnaround of the direction of the city of Munich in terms of public skateparks. The original idea of this new skatepark was to built a flow skatepark in the style of the 70`s for the very little kids, for beginners, the long borders and cruisers and for the old dude which don`t want to drop in anymore and we liked this idea. Unfortunately it turned out different than we hoped because the main designer didn't listen much to our ideas and our doubts of his design. So in the end for sure you can have a lot of fun in this skatepark cruising and speeding around as long as you don`t think about the big mistakes in the design and how much better it could have be done. Go and judge by yourself. The surface is perfect, fast and grippy. It is free and open 24/7. Pads and helmets are required. No lights, no restrooms. It is located in the south-east of Munich. Park your car at the end of the Otto-Hahn-Straße. Skatepark was built by www.bowl.ch Markus Suchanek""",0.0,,,,6082,,,

Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,,,,No,,,150 W. Water St,47150,New Albany,"8/23/2010 The New Albany skatepark sits in the city's (apparently, unnamed) riverfront park, almost directly under the I-64/US 150 bridge that spans the Ohio River. The park looks pretty old; the locals claim that it's been there about 13 years. It shows the age, with cracking concrete and settling slabs everywhere. The construction looks pretty janky, and the overall design and execution are pretty questionable, too. It's definitely kinda ""gnar"", but that also makes it kind of fun, what with the oddball flat-banks everywhere, and the fairly-legitimate ""street"" obstacles (complete with rusty metal rails, several coats of peeling paint, and chunks missing from the concrete). It's only about 15 minutes from Louisville's ""Extreme"" skatepark via I-64, so if you're up for something a little harder to skate, you might wanna swing by for a few runs. -Bud Stratford, The Solitary Life (www.thesolitarylifeof.blogspot.com)",0.0,0.0 ,,,5258,,,

It's brand-new, and well-done, though. The trick seems to be picking the ""right"" obstacles, and putting them in the ""right"" places... and then, keeping them well-maintained. Paoli seems to have gotten the program dialed down pretty good on all three fronts. The park is small... Paoli's certainly not a very big town, anyway... but, it's pretty fun. I'm glad I swung by for a few. If you're going right by it (as I was), you might as well stop in and check it out. -Bud Stratford The Solitary Life",0.0,0.0 ,,City,2869,,,

Skatepark,,,Free,,Yes,No,Concrete,Yes,No,,,1131 Goethals Dr,99352,Richland,"Richland is an interesting park. It was designed by Wormhoudt. The street area was built by Kennewick Concrete, a local company. The bowls were started by a company out of Oregon, Corp. Inc. But due to their inability pour tranny correctly, Grindline was hired to fix and finish their work, and build phase two. Phase two is a sick bowl, designed and built by Grindline. The deep end is similar to the deep end in Aumsville, OR (10 feet deep), and the shallow end is similar to Carnation, WA. Overall this park will serve the community very well. It will have lights, but caution bikes are allowed. Dan H.",0.0,0.0 ,,,4203,,,

I found the park to be well built and packed with a lot of goodies. Bank walls, ditch section, ledges, rails, and a spine bowl that leads into a pool. It all flows together one way or another and the concrete is butter smooth. Coping set just right, with some tight, little pockets in the bowls. They seem to allow ANYTHING that is self propelled, skateboards, bikes, razors scooters and I bet you could bring a wagon or shopping cart in  there. The locals skateboarders there are super cool, while the CFBs (Crazy Freakin Bikers) from Astoria were oblivious to the little kid dropping in, and ran right into him while his parents watched. I really liked the park and thought it added a special touch to my 4th of July in Seaside.  - L8r skaters, Matt Splat",0.0,0.0 ,,,3351,,(503) 738-3311,http://www.sunsetempire.com

Skatepark,yes,Open,Free,Outside,,Yes,Concrete,,No,Breaking Ground Skateparks,Breaking Ground Skateparks,Mill Woods Park,06109,Wethersfield,"Just completed Oct 2005, built by Sloppy Sam & Breaking Ground Skateparks. Probably around 6000 sq. feet, maybe more. It is all concrete with a bowled/banked-in street area that opens to a super-tight backyard style pool with cast in place coping. Shallow end on the pool is 4', down to 8' in the deep end. Unfortunately, the street area has water coming from the base of the jersey barrier, which will have to be fixed in the spring. You can see it easily in the pics. Other than that, its super smooth and all the trannies are perfect. There are no fees, rules are posted - helmets required but nobody seems to wear them, and it is open year round. Bikes in the street area are a problem on busy days. Wethersfield is located just south of Hartford. This is probably the best skatepark in Connecticut, despite the puddles.",0.0,0.0 ,6000 square feet.,City,7920,,,

Some like to think of it as a ""Commune"" well that would be a misconception it is better described as a Dictatorship run by the Tyrant Brewce Martin. Over the years 1000's have donated their time and some money, more time than money though Skate Features include: The Epcot Bean Bowl AKA The Punisher, 13' deep with 6' shallow left hand kidney, skatelite with Pool coping. The King Dong, a multi ramp spine bowled in with a bit of over vert. Surfaced with steel and Skatelite. Sometimes called the Slicer. The Fullpipe, some have called it the Fools Pipe, this has a 20' diameter and is 40 feet wide, it also has a 6' wide section with pool coping for dropping in on, it has about 4 feet of vert there. The Concrete Right hand Kidney is 9' in the deep and 5' in the shallow, with pool coping, this is in the steel building. It features 7' tranny with 2' of vert in the deep while the shallow is 4' tranny with 1' of vert, it's steep for sure. The Lula Bowl, named after the first skateboarder to die at Skatopia, Lula was a Pit Bull that loved to skate it up, she's buried under the deck by the pump bump that's on the deck. It features a cradle, a school bus, pool coping, school bus headlights, and some metal coping too. Oh yeah, there's a Skateboard Museum at Skatopia as well. Upwards of 1800 boards ranging from a 1920's home made wooden scooter to the modern day skateboards. Oh yeah again, Skatopia is open 24/7 and Camping is encouraged, if your cold no problem, there are 13 dogs on the farm to curl up to. Plenty of indoor space to sleep, you can even set your tent up in the barn so it don't get wet. -Dan",0.0,,,Private,7790,,,http://www.skatopia.org/

Since the park has minimal funding, not many objects are installed. Most of the current ramps are wooden, made from locals such as Kasey Tupper, which is no wonder weather is an on going issue in the park. (snow, rain, etc. frequents the area) Plus, vandalism is a big problem, slowing down chances for improvements in the park. Over all, it is a small, unorganized layout but good to screw around in. This park looks like its from the 70s or something, there's a 3 1/2 ft. q. pipe and the wood on it is ok the coping sux, there is a metal pyramid with a grind wall on it, there is a cool grinding rail and a lil grind thing.

Firstly the park is now a pay park-regardless if you are riding or not. They are charging 60rmb on weekends and 50rmb on weekdays. (6/5 euro) not to bad but its a lot of money for the chinese skaters. Therefore the place is dead mostly during the week and a bunch of expat kids on weekends. Kinda sux. But be warned-girlfriends and friends etc will have to pay full entry as well. 2nd the steel park in the photos is no longer there. They moved it to another location and are set to open it with the same prices as smp. Shit, if you come with the intentions of filming or taking pics-try keep it on the down low (pros particularly) they require you to sign a contract stating that you are not allowed to use pics or footage without paying some ridiculous amount of money. It happened to bmx riders morgan wade and jamie bestwick last month. They do have lights-but are never on because they only put them in one position creating major shadows. - Jamie M.",0.0,0.0 ,147000 square feet.,,5847,,,http://www.smpskatepark.com/skate/park.htm

Built by the mediocre skatepark designers (Purkiss Rose), this park actually has some promise. The street section is burly. The handrails are long and high so you won't be trying those for the first time. The stair case in the middle is about a 6 - 7 ft clear. The bowl section is really fun and you can put some good lines together. This park actually flows way more than the other parks in the area. The boob shaped objects are designed perfectly for cracking ollies over 'em and doing slides over the top. Also the tranny gets steep enough to lock into smith grinds etc. If you're coming from LA its one of the better nearby parks. The only major complaint about the bowl area is that everything is really close together so as soon as you come off of one wall then you're into something else.

They're very proud of their cute and clean little city, so don't leave the trash cans out where anyone can see'em or you'll get a hefty fine...  Anyway, they're opening a cute little skate park made of Spohn Ranch mini-ramps and obstacles, and they're so afraid of ""the element"" that they have TWO fences around the skating area to keep out the unwanted during non-operating hours.  So I thought it'd be fun to overrun all the clean crisp south Pasadena skater kids and their mommies and daddies with a pack of oldster, unshaven killer skaters with serious chops. Flood the place with everyone they didn't want in their skatepark, namely, anyone old enough to drive, or anyone not rich enough to live there (they aimed the skatepark at 10-15 yr olds... and to accommodate people who can't legally drive they spent most of the skatepark money on a twenty-space parking lot... for mommy's suv when she drives junior the three blocks to the skatepark).

But seriously, the park is small but tight with smooth transitions. Continuity can be found between the combined bowls with one large bowl over-vertical, and a capsule that is just right and comfortable for upside-down rides. The street course is very basic and offers very little for street skaters. Vert and over-vert is where is at, at this small, yet rad skate park. A good place to stay is the Western Inn (Tel.

Very smooth concrete work, the coping is on right and the layout is nice. It is basically split into two parts, the street section and the bowl section. It has good flow and you can just blast around the place when it's not crowded. I loved it. Plenty of ledges and rails for the flip trick set and a nice big multi bowl for the old school set. It's right next to a big video arcade/fun center so when the sun is too much you can take a break.  I don't think pads are required, I didn't see anyone wearing any and no cops came by when I was there.  The bowls only get to about 6 feet deep in the biggest part and are fun. All kinds of lines can be found here. I would have to give this park an 8 out of 10.

We have taken over the defunct park that closed, and completed a new street course demo. Took out the old street area, threw in what kids really wanted in a true street course.. The best part was re-doing the older bowl, after 7 years it took a good abuse. But bondo went down, sanded the crap out of that layered a nice SKATELITE layer and its fast as shit.

Dudes who kinda suck like me will still have a blast whipping through the different corners spraying pool dust all over the place like confetti.

All skaters will the unique, never-before-seen elements of the street area which have to skated to be understood.

There are numerous rolled lip areas for all level skaters to use, including two above wall extensions, flat banks, raised transitions and other features to challenge all age skaters. James Hendricks, lead designer for Team Pain Enterprises, a nationally known skate park design company, designed the skate park with input from local skaters. City of Tallahassee Parks and Recreation and Streets and Drainage Division crews along with Blankenship Contracting employees built the Skate Park. The Streets and Drainage Division paved the parking lot. These efforts, along with additional community support enabled the City to stretch their original $100,00 allocation into what is now a $400,000 facility.  Tallahassee Skate Park Rules ?

There is something like a 12' quarter on the other side with 2 elbows from the spine to the quarter to the other quarter. The rest still isn't finished as of January, but I guess the whole park should be finished by the end of this summer. I think it's worth checking out, the skaters there seem to like it a lot. How in the HELL did this town get a skatepark anyway?!? - Josh  Well this park is somewhat different than most being built by crappy landscape architects. This one is an actual bowl! The side on the right isn't finished yet and I don't know when plans for it to be done are. The hip is real good going into he deep end but there isn't a lot of time to turn around and go back the other way.

Fundraising and organizing is ongoing through the ""Skate Board"" an advisory board to the Parks and Recreation Department. This spring and summer the site will be landscaped and an art/painting project will be organized.  The park is an unsupervised, self-policed park. Any users must abide by the rules of the park at all times.

Check out the pictures; You'll see that it has three ""bowl complexes"" of varying heights (with various obstacles scattered around inside them, to make them even more challenging), plus a fairly large ""street"" section with more ledge and box combos than you can even count. The park is lighted until about 11 PM, and is one of the better concrete parks in the state. If you don't know how to skate bowls or transitions, this is a good place to start learning. This park is worth a good 4- to 5-hour drive, at the very least.  -Bud Stratford  Fun park overall. The main bowl has a gnarly kink in one wall that will throw you off if you're not careful.

There is the big bowl that goes from 6ft to 10 ft and shaped like a bomb with real good pool coping. A small 4ft bowl with metal coping. The street course has some really interesting elements. Like a 6 ft bank with a 4 ft kinked vert extension(Punk Wall) on top of it. Two 3ft tall with 3ft transition quarter pipes. The Bloomington skatepark was built by Dreamland but designed by a poser architectural firm in California. As a result, the craftsmanship is incredible and the transitions brilliant- but the design is not as amazing as what Dreamland is capable of creating. The park boast two bowls, the large having 8 1/2 foot trannies with 1 1/2 foot vert. The park design was hoping to incorporate a large street area while not forgetting the local trannies. This is a brand new park built by Dreamland with the persistent help of Local (Biker)Bart Smith? The 10 foot bowl is sweet with the white chocolate pool coping. The park is worth the drive.

I took that as a cue to snake as many of the slow-Florida locals as possible. Hey, time is money. The park has all of the standard Vans skatelite street obstacles, a 4foot mini spine ramp, and giant a 6 to 10 foot mini ramp, with everything in between in heights. The vert ramp is the standard set up, 40ish feet wide, 12 feet tall, an extension, metal coping, fast, nets around it. All well done skate terrain. The biggest disappointment of the park though is the bowl. It starts out right, with a double deepend at about 8 feet and pool coping. But then about two thirds of the rest of the bowl is about 5 to 3 feet deep with really mellow transitions and way-way-way too much flat bottom. Not much flow in the bowl. Way too much flat bottom for any real speed lines. The temptation for the young ones to push across the flat bottom should tell it all. Bad use of cement. But we still sessioned it for a good hour of the two hour time limit, and had a good time. If you are in Orlando, you should at least go there for the novelty of it all, but it is nothing compared to the public parks in the rest of the country, and the $0 admission fees.

Vertical Exploration Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Mixture,,No,,,"San Jose Ward, Road 485",,Quebradillas,"I have an update for the Puerto Rico Skateparks:  The former wood and metal Roller Vertical Exploration Skatepark is no more.  In it's place we now have a new concrete skatepark at the same site, that rivals some of the best in Florida, Colorado, and even California.  Thanks to Federal funds, the town of Quebradillas built one of the best parks I have ever ridden, a dream come true for me, since I live near by... Skate park extraordinaire, Stephan Hauser (Placed to Ride), was the selected bid to build the park and did an outstanding job with the scarce funds.  He used a group of community volunteers, (skater, in-line skaters, BMXrs) from the Roller Vertical Exploration clan such as Jorge Morales, Migue Ramos, Juanra, and many others from all walks of life to maximize the resources and come up with an amazing product.   The park sits on roughly an acre of land with a stunning view of the Atlantic Ocean.  It has a small street/beginners area that most hardcore street skaters do not like, but that's where they usually stop.  This park is true karma for real bowl riders and surfers, as the upper bowl has a perfect pill shape, which connects via waterfalls to increasingly vertical terrain that flows smoothly from transition to transition and offers a variety of walls and bowls as deep as 12 feet down.  Ride 'till your heart's content... To get to this park look for PR road # 485 off PR # 2 and head 2.5 miles East from the town of Quebradillas.  You will find the San Jose Chapel, and right across the street hides one of the best parks you will ever ride in your life. If you surf, you will find good karma here, as there are numerous surf spots nearby.  Have a good skate session before and/or after a good surf!!!  We do... For more information and directions they can call me at (787)955-5069 or at the shop at (787)895-7900.

I asked a couple of groms at the local skate shop for directions, and they were happy to oblige (pretty damn accurate directions I may add!) Anyway, the temp in Las Vegas that day was 115, I decided I would wait until dusk to go skate.....luckily for me, the skatepark has lights and is open until 10 p.m. Upon arrival, I was quite impressed with this concrete park. after surveying the scene, I decided the snake run would be good to start off with, since all the rollerblade fags and bike kooks were riding the other kiddie bullshit. The snake run is legitimate! It has 4 turns, and leads into a 5-ft bowl....pretty cool! Since I was such a newcomer, I didn't realize that the bike dorks used one of the hips in the snake run for their stupid bike fag tricks.... Big mistake!!! within 5 minutes of me riding there, I ran into a biker during his big move and got speared fucking hard by his handlebars right into my side! damn.....that hurt!!! I still have a bruise!! Anyway....... the rest of the park is pretty cool too! Tons of hips, elevators, banks, curves etc. everywhere. Metal coping caps off the entire park.

Waldport Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,No,Yes,Concrete,Yes,No,Airspeed,Airspeed,Crestline Dr and Salmon St.,97394,Waldport,"  The pictures are definitely better than the park. Waldport is a sand pit. A good idea, but not carried through. There is no grass or landscaping around the park, so there is a fine coat of sand over the whole place. I had to use a towel from my trunk to scoop out mud and pine cones from the drain area. The walls are also slathered up with some sealant that sweats and adds to the slip factor. The park is surrounded by Oregon redwoods and it is in the shade 90 percent of the day, which means it doesn't really dry. You can tell it is not really a favorite among the awesome Oregon parks because there is really no daily skaters sessioning, except for the 10 and under age bracket. It is a shame really. It looks killer. You can get up on that 6 foot over vert wall, but the walls are wavy by today's standards (Glendale, Lincoln City, Etnies, Poway...) Worth the stop because you may get lucky and find it dry, but bring a broom and a towel.  -Tony Misiano",3.7,0.0 ,,City,4136,,,

Warren Township Skate Plaza & Trail,,,Free,Outdoor,No,No,concrete,,,,,Warren Township Skate Plaza & Trail,60031,Gurnee,"Pictures are by Nate Mollison from  >http://www.death-grip.com  Here's the info on the skatepark in Gurnee, Illinois. The official name is the Warren Township Skate Plaza & Trail. It opened back in the late fall 2002. The park is gated, so check the hours before going there, they have a few ""bike"" days a week too. The park is made up of four areas (so to speak). From left to right as you enter the park, you have the main ""big"" bowl, which ranges around four feet deep, there are a few extensions around the bowl. There's lots of flat, so bring your skate legs. It's possible to ride the entire bowl, but you gotta work it. The island thing has jacked transitions and is lower than the rim of the bowl. One really screwy feature id the huge stairway on the far wall... yeah let's break up the flow with a nice stair set!! Most kids use this big bowl to get speed and transfer over to the smaller bowl. The small bowl is maybe three feet deep? Of course they had to throw in a ledge to break up a corner... This bowl is good for learning new stuff mostly. This bowl tends to be the most crowded whenever I was there. The next area has a pyramid/rail gizmo, again placement makes no sense and gets a little use. The final area is a really odd bank to round wall bowl that has a odd shaped pyramid that is over sized in the middle of course tucked in there to halt all hopes of flow. I rarely saw kids in this bowl. There is another feature here that is outside the gated park called the skate trail, a path that has various obstacles along it, rails, fun boxes, etc. I always saw kids sessioning this path so it seems to be a good hit for the street skaters.  The concrete at this park isn't bad, the main bowl is actually really smooth, just lots of flat. By far this park should only earn a visit if you live in the area.

Washington Street,no,Open,Free,Outside,No,No,Concrete,,No,,,W Washington St and Pacific Hwy,92123,San Diego,"If you think I'm going to say one negative word about this park, you are out of your mind. The majority of the park has been poured, and the crew is working on some finishing touches. Actually, the great thing about this place is that it's likely to evolve and change with time and, therefore, it will never be 100% completed. The park can be broken down into four primary sections: the flow bowl section; the center bowl; the snake run section; and the pool. The main action occurs in the flow bowl section of the park, which features the S-shaped pump dong surrounded by a vert cinderblock punk wall on the left side, the big vert wall with the U-channel in the middle, the loveseat corner on the right side, and smaller bowl sections topped with pool coping, parking block coping, deathbox, etc. The bigger walls are about 9-11 feet tall, while the front of the flow area is about 5 feet tall, with tight tranny, pool coping, and a long loveseat in the middle of the wall. In the front right corner of the flow area is a small curved wall that shoots you into a 4 foot high vert wall. Very fun. You could say that the parking block spine, located in the front left corner of the flow bowl section, separates the flow section from the snake run section. You could also say that all of this stuff is connected together. Whatever. The spine leads into a tight ""shallow end"" pocket, a cinderblock wallride, and some flat banks that form a hip. Directly in front of the wallride is the gnarly center bowl, which is capped with pool coping, has about a 9 foot deep end, an uphill shallow end pocket with nice blue tiles, a deathbox that few will master, and an extension of about 3-4 vertical feet. Yikes. As you skate from the wallride to the bowl, be sure to pay your respects to the OG rail - your only opportunity to hit a ""street"" obstacle. But wait, there's more. The snake run portion goes around the center bowl and towards the pool in the back of the park. The highlight of this section is the oververt semi-cradle corner, which must be about 16 feet tall. In the snake run, you'll enjoy some tight turns, pool coping, hips, waterfalls, and a deathbox, until you reach the bowled end, which is tight and slightly oververt. The self-contained pool sits directly behind the U-channel in the main section. The pool is an amoeba shape with two sidewall pockets that form rounded hips. The deep end is about 8 feet, with a little bit of vert. The signature feature of the pool is the shallow end hip that is formed into one of the round bridge pillars. The pillar creates a challenging vert extension in the shallow end. The park also boasts a number of distinctive artistic elements, including the cool mosaic that greets you, the nice rebar art welded into the fencing, creative use of tile accents around the entire park, and the BBQ and miniature pool that serves as a sink or ice chest. The BBQ might just be the best feature in the entire park. Hats of to the WSVT crew for building this place, for fighting the fight with the city folks, and for creating such a novel design. This will be the best and the most challenging skatepark in SoCal for many many years. - M. Tak.",0.0,,,,6259,,,http://washingtonstreetskatepark.org/

The hip is really fun, and this park just tests your technical abilities and your imagination. - Vinny G. This park is a free, concrete, outdoors playground. Padding is not required. A step up in height and in design over the first wave of concrete shit holes. Though not all trannies are perfectly curved they can all be ridden outright and your imagination is the only thing limiting the possibilities at this park! You'll notice that the bowl is about 7 foot deep with a channel and a spine. The pyramid has a good amount of room around it with a nicely placed cement ledge at the top. The there is a BIG hip for blasting over ( about 5-6 feet high) then there is a tall quarter that's grindable with a lower quarter next to that that has a good hip off of it. All this is surrounded with a 2-3 foot high bowl that even wraps around the deep bowl. This makes for some awesome transfers! Not to mention that crazy ass little 3 way prong pyramid that is like a key to unlock tricks you didn't think are possible.  -J. Greenwood",0.0,,,,3439,,,

The locals are a bit bewildered by bowl riding, but some caught on pretty quick after we showed them how and what can be done. There old mini halfpipe is in the parking lot next to it. Yikes!!!

Wheeling Skate Park,no,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,Yes,,Grindline,Grindline,1 Community St,26003,Wheeling,"10/8/2007 The City is in the process of adding amenities which will include permanent restrooms. Currently there are porta-a-jons and a water fountain on site. A beverage machine is coming shortly, as is a paved parking lot, landscaping, spectator seating and lighting. The park currently closes at dusk. 2/5/07 SKATEPARK BUILDER SELECTED WHEELING - Grindline Skateparks, based in Seattle, Wash., has been selected by the  city of Wheeling Skatepark Technical Review Committee to build Wheeling?s  concrete skatepark.  Wheeling City Council will hear first reading Tuesday night in an ordinance choosing Grindline Skateparks to design and build the Wheeling Skatepark. Grindline is known for its design and construction of concrete skateparks all over the United States and in other parts of the world. Grindline has built more than 75 skateparks to date, from Orcas Island in Washington State to the island of Okinawa, Japan. The Review Committee reviewed qualifications from five reputable skatepark builders. After narrowing their search to three companies,  they finally reviewed proposals from Grindline and Team Pain, of Winter Park, Fla. Grindlines proposal is for a 8,500 square foot to 10,000-square-foot  concrete skatepark with a cost of up to $330,300. Construction is expected to begin in April, with a grand opening tentatively scheduled for August.  The skatepark will be built in Elm Grove, adjacent to the Wheeling Heritage Trail and at the bottom of the hill leading to the Chambers Baseball/Softball Complex. The grassroots efforts was led by Wheeling resident, Diana Mey, whose son Nathan approached Wheeling City Council at age 12 to ask for their help. The Wheeling Skatepark Committee has raised more than $175,000 in donations and grants. Donations came in from local foundations, individuals, and businesses. The Tony Hawk Foundation funded the Wheeling Skatepark Committee twice, with a  total donation amounting to $26,000. The City of Wheeling dedicated $67,000 last year to the committee, and has since applied for a Land and Water Conservation Fund Grant in the amount of $100,000, bringing the total funds available to approximately $275,000. The Wheeling Skatepark Committee partnered with the Community Foundation of the Ohio Valley to administer the funds.

Lots of ledges too, but nothing over 6 feet tall which means it's a beginner to intermediate park only! -J. Greenwood  This is Jeff Grosso's favorite park of all the city parks around. The park is fairly small, but actually isn't too bad. It's got a good small rail, another double kinked rail, a typical up-flat-down rail over a pyramid, and a good assortment of ledges, banks, and trannies. There's a small spine, and a very cool bowl. It's 5 and 6 feet deep, with the deep end formed by raising the deck and coping. It's a pretty basic small capsule, but it's reasonably smooth and has a weird extension channel thing that makes for interesting riding. Definitely one of the better parks in the recent batch of SoCal cement. - Mark Waters (Skatepunk.net)  It's great if you want to try something new, lots of challenges for the beginner and not so beginner.

Wilson Beach Skatepark,,,Free,Outside,Yes,No,Concrete,,,Site Design,,Wilson Beach,60640,Chicago,"Two bowls and a street course. FREE. Great old-school clover bowl with concrete coping. Deep end is about 8 feet deep with 1 foot vert. Shallow end is about 5 feet deep with two lobes. Lines galore. There are some facets (flat spots), but all-in-all a really nice pool. Huge 6 ft deep non-vert bowl that is mitten-shaped with an island in the middle of the hand and two extension walls. Great transitions, great hips. It can be hard to keep momentum unless you are good at hip transfers. Metal coping is sort of inconsistent, in some spots it doesn't stick out, in other places it sticks way out. The edge also has some spots where it dips back from where it is supposed to be. Not complaining one bit. This place rocks hard. Hey , I just thought I would send you this picture of the 8 foot amoeba bowl at Wilson skatepark in Chicago.. It has real cement coping, and is very much like a real pool, except it lacks tile, deathbox and light. Submitted by Eggvert / AG. Just passing through Chicago. The locals shred.  Pretty cool bowls and good street area, its brand new!  I just sessioned Wilson Beach park in Chicago. Great site design park.  The pool is a lot like Chino's but the pocket to the side in the shallow is not as far cut out. Same trannies in the deep and shallow though. The coping is hand molded so it is a bit different there. No tile either. The flow area/bowl is great, typical of site design. Big open bowl with an island in the center, lots of hips and corners. The locals say there is too much flat, but I liked it. You just had to work harder to get from hip to hip rather than cutting straight across the flat.  - Tony Misiano",0.0,,,City,8350,,,http://www.chitownshred.com

I'd guess it's Spohn Ranch ramps and the setup looked good and there are lots of ramps including a mini that spines to a quarterpipe and a micro miniramp.

Overall, some basic maintenance would improve this park a great deal, but as it is right now it sucks to ride.  Andrew",0.0,0.0 ,,,4194,,(605) 668-5231,

This style of skate park exists all over the two coasts and Canada, however, this is the first of its kind in the Midwest. I have attached photos of the park as it stands today. We hope to have the facility open for business the first week in October. Funding for the facility came from all three cities and the YMCA and fundraising from private donors. The City of Edina is essentially leasing the property to the YMCA, who is actually operating the facility. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

However, there's still a lot of fun to be had at this skatepark and it does provide some interesting skating.

The new section is rather small but includes a nice 6-8ft deep horseshoe bowl and two other 2-4 foot quarter pipes, plus a 7-stair walkway featuring small hubba ledges on each side. The big bowl is really well done with thick metal pipe coping and a small roll-in section. The trannies on the bowl have a lot of transition (nearly no vert). I took two pictures today (Monday) and am having them developed tomorrow. I'll email you a copy by the end of the week. In my opinion and the opinion of many others at the park today, this makes Yucaipa much better and provides some meaningful variety to the place. - Geoff  This park lacks anything that stands out. A lot of the transitions are unusable and/or kinked. This makes the punk walls very punk. There are 2 ledges and 2 rails the are fairly easy hits, the rest kinda blows.  It's a fairly good park, it has 3 rails,2 ledges and some concrete blocks, a little pyramid, a couple banks, and there's a big 7 stair in the back. And also in the back theres a curved quarter pipe, and there's 2 quarter pipes where the pyramid is. And there's a quarter pipe in front of a nice big bowl they have, its like, 6 or 7 feet I think, and theres a little hiking trail that people go on.",0.0,0.0 ,,City,3705,,(909) 797-2489,
